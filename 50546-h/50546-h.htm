<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Would</span> that the George Hotel had an old gable,
or even an Elizabethan window,” I said to myself
as I unshouldered my knapsack; “but perhaps the
ordinary visitor thinks more of creature comforts
than of artistic effects.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything of antiquity about the house?”
I inquired, turning to the waiter.</p>

<p>“Not that I know of,” was the reply;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> “but it is a
very ancient establishment. There is a fresco two
hundred years old in one of the rooms,” he added,
with a little pride.</p>

<p>I took out my notebook and pencil, and was shown
into a ground-floor room in the western and earlier
part of the hotel to see this curiosity. Alas! it
proved to be nothing but an old paperhanging.</p>

<p>“Not very remarkable,” I said, carelessly.</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir!”</p>

<p>“I am expecting some friends by the next train,”
I continued. “We shall require dinner for three.
What can we have?”</p>

<p>The waiter was pretty well acquainted with the
productions of the culinary department, which had
not much charm of novelty, and after settling that
important business, I sallied forth to purchase a guide-book.
This was not the first time I had been at
Winchester, and much of the information it contained
was not new to me; but I wished to refresh my
memory on some points, as the friends I was
expecting looked to me to be their <i>cicerone</i> during
the few days we were to spend here together.</p>

<p>Reading some and skipping more, and glancing at
the well-known illustrations, I thought myself fairly
acquainted with the subject, especially as I had
rummaged up something from old books and manuscripts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
in London. I wished to stand well with
the old gentleman and his daughter for certain
reasons which I shall not mention&mdash;because I may
be unsuccessful. Well&mdash;we shall see.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival.</div>

<p>Here they are!&mdash;warm greetings&mdash;the luggage is
lifted down, and by degrees the small articles which
accompany a lady’s travels were brought in, counted,
and arranged. Do the number and variety of them
cause me to hesitate or to reflect that in single
blessedness&mdash;</p>

<p>Conversation soon becomes more connected, and,
in due course, allusion is made to the object of our

<p>“Now, mind you tell us <i>everything</i> about Winchester,”
said Miss Hertford, with a smiling emphasis,
which showed that she intended to be obeyed.</p>

<p>“Everything, and some other things,” I replied,
submissively;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> “but perhaps you under-estimate the
extent of the mine which is here beneath our feet.
You are an enchantress, and if you wish to become

<p class="noindent">ever since the days of Edward <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> Had a Visitors
Book been kept, what a rare collection of autographs
would it have contained! In the twentieth
year of Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> we read of the “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">In of
the George</span>” being leased by the Mayor to one
Stephen Boddam, on condition that he pays the
rent fixed and forty shillings towards the new
making of the chimney.<a name="Anchor_1" id="Anchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a> The name of the house
was taken from the patron saint of England, pork-dealer,
bishop, and dragon-slayer; to whom we find
a chapel in Winchester dedicated in Henry <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>’s
time.<a name="Anchor_2" id="Anchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sufferings of a Royalist.</div>

<p>The stable at the back is the oldest part. It
has a dingy aspect, and an unpleasant association.
When Waller was here making demands upon the
citizens in 1643, one Master Say, a son of a Prebendary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the Cathedral, directed his servant to
conceal his horses. Betrayed and brought before
Waller, he was questioned, and his answers being
deemed unsatisfactory, was handed over to the
Provost Marshal to extract a confession. He was
forthwith taken into the “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">eighteen-stall stable</span>,” a
halter was placed round his neck, and, as he still
refused information, he was pulled up and down to
the rack until nearly strangled. All the spectators
retired in disgust&mdash;they could not stand the sight.</p>

<p>“How dreadful!” exclaimed Miss Hertford. “Did
the poor man die?”</p>

<p>“It very nearly finished him,” I returned; “but
people were pretty strong in those days. However,
he had, as a result, a dangerous illness.”</p>

<p>There is no better starting-point than the
“George,” in the centre of the High Street, for
exploring Winchester. This was the chief street in
Roman times, and perhaps terminated in such a
round arch as we see at Lincoln. In the palmy
days of the city good houses probably adorned the
street. There seems to have been a fashionable
tailor here in the days of John and Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>
His cut was evidently appreciated, for he was not
only employed by the King, but given wood to repair
his house, Limafelda, the rent of which was a grey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
pelise for the King. We may conclude there was
also a grand harness maker: for John ordered the
Mayor to give the constable of Corfe Castle a
handsome (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pulchra</span>) saddle, with a scarlet saddle-cloth
and gilt bridle.<a name="Anchor_3" id="Anchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a></p>

<p>The scene had greatly changed by Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>’s
time. The houses, mostly wooden and thatched, had
gardens in front of them, of a somewhat Irish character,
for the walls were dilapidated,<a name="Anchor_4" id="Anchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a> and they contained
few flowers, but many sweet&mdash;pigs. A civic order
was now made that householders should no longer
keep “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">hog-sties</span>” within the boundaries of the “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">hie</span>”
street. Those were times of darkness&mdash;there were no
town-lights, and some apprehension was felt that even
the supply of candles might run short. And so, in
the fifteenth year of Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>, it was ordered by
the Winchester “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">assemble</span>” that the chandlers
“<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">should make</span>” good and well-burning candles, and
“should see there was no lack of them.”<a name="Anchor_5" id="Anchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> In Charles
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s time the citizens were bidden to hang out lights
while the King was in residence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Westgate.</div>

<p>Now let us come to a nearer date, and imagine this
street a hundred years ago. An open drain ran down
it, and lines of gables and overhanging storeys
nodded across at each other in grotesque infirmity.
A pretty picture they made, and there was one
night in the year on which they seemed to me to
be sadly missing&mdash;the fifth of November&mdash;when tar
barrels were lit at the Westgate and kicked down the
street by an exulting mob. A grand scene it was of
riot and wildfire, and only wanted the quaint, irregular
buildings to complete the effect.</p>

<p>“When Keats was here in 1819,” said Mr. Hertford,
“he found the place much modernized and
‘improved.’ He says the side streets were excessively
maiden-lady-like; the doorsteps were always
fresh from the flannel, and the knockers had a
staid, serious, almost awful quietness about them.
Never did he see such a quiet collection of lions’ and
rams’ heads.”<a name="Anchor_6" id="Anchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a></p>

    <p class="caption">
       West Gate, Winchester.
    </p>
</div>

<p>The first object that attracted our attention on
our walks was the Westgate, which crowns the
High Street, and is beautiful with its ivy, arches,
and two Decorated windows. There is a warm
semi-domestic character in the fortifications of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
town&mdash;a charm distinct from that of the colder
grandeur of the Castle and Cathedral. As we
approach the gate, we pass the Star Inn.</p>

<p>“That unpretentious building,” I said, “stands on
holy ground.<a name="Anchor_7" id="Anchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a></p>

<p>“Graves of unknown age, Roman coins and vases
were found there when digging for the foundations in
1885. It is thought that a palace of Queen Emma
stood on or near its site. There was a hostel
named ‘La Starre’ in Winchester in the reign of
Henry <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prisoners.</div>

<p>We now approach and stand before the gate. Had
we been here in the fourteenth century&mdash;on a Sunday
morning&mdash;during the fair, we should have found
ourselves surrounded by a chattering crowd, buying
bread at the stalls here erected; while close to us on
the left (south), would have risen a grim tower in
haughty grandeur. It stood just in front of where
are now the stairs of the office of the Hampshire
Friendly Society&mdash;a slight inequality in the road
can be observed over the foundations. This was a
part of the ancient castle, which some say was built
by FitzOsborne at the Conqueror’s command, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
others<a name="Anchor_8" id="Anchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a> observe that we have no allusion to it till the
days of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> In Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s reign it is often
mentioned. Some say that previously the Saxon
palace stood here. This palace has been well jolted
about by topographers, most of whom place it in the
Square behind the Butter Cross. The result is that
we have here a couple of prisoners, and do not know
where to put them. One of these is Stigand,
Bishop of Winchester, and afterwards archbishop.
His treasures were not entirely in the other world,
but he kindly kept a correct account of them, and
wore his key on a chain round his neck, so that on
his death in 1070, William had no difficulty in
turning his store into the royal coffers. The other
sufferer was a young Saxon of the name of Meaw.
It appears that the Conqueror’s wife, Matilda, was
not so busy with her Bayeux tapestry and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbaye
aux Dames</i> as to forget all about this aggravating
person. He would care nothing for her, and she
determined to be revenged. So she had him shut up
somewhere in Winchester, that he might have leisure
to reflect on the advantages of being “willing and
free.” Prisons were not then as they are now&mdash;some
of the best warmed and ventilated places&mdash;there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
no good food and attentive doctors, and after a short
time poor Meaw was beyond the reach both of love
and hatred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Domesday Book.</div>

<p>In this Castle was the “exchequer,” that is, the
depository of records and treasure. Among the
valuables it contained for a considerable time was
the celebrated Domesday Book, or a copy of it,
which is first mentioned as the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber de Thesauro</span>,”
appealed to in a case argued before Queen Matilda
“in the treasury of the Castle of Winchester,”<a name="Anchor_9" id="Anchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a> about
the year 1108. The original rolls disappeared at an
early date, perhaps in some conflagration, but the
Winton book, that describing this locality, is a more
full copy from them than is the larger Domesday
Book for the whole of England. Authorities differ
as to when this book was removed from Winchester.
In the seventh year of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, there appears a
charge in the <cite class="plain">Pipe Rolls</cite> for conveying the “arca”
from Winchester to London, and in the London
Record Office there is a curious chest in which this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
book was kept at Westminster. It is about five feet
square, formed of iron nearly an inch thick, and
strengthened with heavy girders and studs. This
may have been the very ark above mentioned.</p>

<p>“In order to see this castle we must ante-date
our existence three hundred years.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could,” said Mr. Hertford, “then we
should have no trouble about Home Rule or County
Councils.”</p>

<p>“Suppose then,” I proceeded, “we are standing in
front of the old tower I have mentioned, and admiring
its handsome mouldings of cut stone. If we are
allowed to enter and explore we shall find beneath
it three subterranean passages radiating in different
directions&mdash;one to the east, passing into the town,
with a view probably of taking sanctuary in churches;
another to the south, leading towards the hall; and
a third to the west, ending in a sally port outside
the town. Passing through this entrance tower we
have on our left an embattled wall (where the paved
walk now runs) meeting the end of the hall,<a name="Anchor_10" id="Anchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a> and on
our right another wall (along the course of the iron
railing of the Friendly Society), extending to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
State apartments&mdash;the site of the present County
Offices. The original Norman Castle&mdash;a tower fifty-two
feet square and fourteen thick, which stood
where the Jubilee Queen now sits in front of the
hall&mdash;was demolished at an early date. The
succeeding castle had round towers, between thirty
and forty feet wide, and from eight to ten
thick.<a name="Anchor_11" id="Anchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a> Beyond the hall was an inner court, or
‘pleasaunce,’ with four towers, one at each corner;
one is still visible, and one stood where the officers’
quarters are; one probably belonging to the Castle,
but somewhat distant, and perhaps detached, was
found in the railway cutting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Castle.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>“A remarkable, if not fabulous event, took place
‘in the hall of Winchester Castle’ (or palace) in
Edward the Confessor’s time. The story goes that
one of the serving-men in bringing in a dish slipped
one foot, but saved himself with the other. Earl
Godwin being in good spirits, perhaps, at the termination
of the almost endless grace, attempted a
joke&mdash;a somewhat hazardous venture before the
Confessor. ‘So should one brother support the
other,’ quoth he. Edward was down upon him in
a moment. ‘So might I have been now assisted
by my brother Alfred, if Earl Godwin had not
prevented it.’ The Earl protested that he had no
connection with that murder; ‘might the next morsel
be his last if he had.’ He ate and tried to swallow,
but the food and the lie stuck in his throat, and he
fell dead under the table.”</p>

<p>“I have read, somewhere,” observed Mr. Hertford,
“that there is no truth in that story beyond the fact
that the Earl died suddenly at a banquet here, and
was buried in the Cathedral. It has a Norman
flavour.”</p>

<p>We find that Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> bought a place in Winchester
for his mews, which remained in the hands
of John and Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr><a name="Anchor_12" id="Anchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a> John in his fifth year gave
to Matthew Wallop “the custody of our house and
castle gates and gaol in Winchester for the service
of his keeping at his cost our birds put in the Castle
to be mewed, finding one servant to mew them, and
keep throughout the mewing time. And he shall find
three hare hounds for each season.”<a name="Anchor_13" id="Anchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a> John also
ordered a Columbarium to be made in the Castle.<a name="Anchor_14" id="Anchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a></p>

</div>

<p>While we were admiring the exterior of the hall I
thought of the grim ornaments with which the Castle
was once adorned. Here was placed by Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>
a quarter of the last native Prince of Wales. Here
Queen Isabella exhibited the head of Earl Despencer.
As I was musing, a labourer came out,
and we were enabled to enter the building.</p>

<p>“Magnificent!” exclaimed Mr. Hertford. “What
a length and height; and look at those tall, blue shafts
of Purbeck marble!”</p>

<p>“Those pillars and aisles,” I replied, “have led
some to mistake it for a church. But although we
read of four chapels in the Castle&mdash;the chief of
which was to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Josse&mdash;this was not among them.
The length is 110 feet. The old entrance to the hall,
the mouldings of which are still visible, was used
towards the end of the last century, and corresponded
with that still existing on the south side.”<a name="Anchor_15" id="Anchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arthur’s Table.</div>

<p>At the west end are the remains of a daïs, and a
curious orifice, supposed to be for communicating by
word of mouth with the State apartments. Over
this, like a large target, hangs the famous “round
table” of King Arthur&mdash;a mystery for centuries. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the reign of Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, who was much here, and had
his birth-room in the Castle coloured with fresh green,
when there were statues in the porch, marble pillars,
and a painted chamber, there were also here a
“Mappa Mundi” and a “Wheel of Fortune.” The
latter seems suggestive, and the Round Tower, built by
Wykeham, at Windsor, and called the Round Table,
may have been taken from this; but we hear nothing
of it till Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>’s reign,<a name="Anchor_16" id="Anchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a> and the present painting
dates from Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>, who specially showed the
work of art to the Emperor Charles <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> Round it are
inscribed the names of Arthur’s knights, and in the
centre is a picture of a king in voluminous robes,
much more like a Tudor monarch than a British
warrior.<a name="Anchor_17" id="Anchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a> Tradition says that Arthur founded this
Castle. He and his companions, when divested of
their French motley, represent the conflict which
raged between the Christian Britons and the pagan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Saxons. It is said that he gained a great victory
in this neighbourhood, and so fondly did the conquered
and oppressed natives recall the memory of their
beloved champion, that they fancied he would come
again&mdash;</p>

<p>Great improvements were made in the Castle by
Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, for which the forest of Bere was mainly
contributory. The order is extant in which the

give the money for the construction of a great hall
at the Castle,<a name="Anchor_19" id="Anchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a> and oaks were to be cut for forming

to Southampton, would be able to furnish ample

repairing the Castle was to be brought from
“Kerebroc,” in the Isle of Wight.<a name="Anchor_21" id="Anchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a></p>

<p>Twenty-five thousand slates were placed upon
the roof, and the queen’s chamber was panelled with
Irish oak. By the time Elizabeth came to the
throne, the Castle was in a somewhat dilapidated
state. From a letter of the Commissioners in
1570, we find that the ditch and rampart on the
west part of the Castle was overgrown with moss
and small bushes; it contained three acres. The
Castle green was let, together with the “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">old walls
and ruinous void romes</span>” there&mdash;the lessee to keep
it clean for Sessions and Assizes. The Mayor had
lately repaired the roof of the hall; the Queen had
spent much money on its south aisle, but the
north aisle was so greatly decayed that the whole
edifice was in danger of falling. After this report,<a name="Anchor_22" id="Anchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a>
some repairs were probably undertaken.</p>

<p>“Do not we see,” I continued, “as we stand

<div class="sidenote">The Hall.</div>

<p>“James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> gave the Castle to Benjamin Tichborne&mdash;a
name recalling a recent contest; and Charles
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> demolished most of it for the construction of
his more luxurious palace.</p>

<p>“In Edward the First’s reign the Bishop of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Andrews though only a prisoner of war who had
opposed the King in Scotland, was confined here
in irons. It was then the rule rather than the
exception for such prisoners to be chained. A
Parliament was held here by Isabella and Mortimer,
and a cruel scene then followed the incarceration
of Edmund of Woodstock. He was brought out
in front of the main entrance to the Castle (through
the city wall) to be executed. There he was kept
“from morn till dewy eve” in a state of painful
suspense, for, to the credit of all, no one would be
induced to do the cruel deed. At last a prisoner,
to save his own life, decapitated him.”</p>

<p>“I have often wondered,” observed Mr. Hertford,
“how any one could be induced to perform this
odious office against the lives of celebrated men.
We know the difficulty there was in the case of
Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, how disguises were used and what
suspicions there were as to who were the two
executioners.”</p>

<p>“We have another sensational scene here,” I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
proceeded, “before the time of Charles. When James
<abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> came to the throne the Castle Green was again
reddened with blood. Eleven persons, among them
Raleigh, were tried for conspiring against the King
and State. Several were condemned, as were Lord
Grey de Wilton and Lord Cobham, who were tried
in this hall.</p>

<p>“I can see,” I said, “two men pacing up and
down here in great mental perturbation. Three
have already suffered on the Green, and Markham
and Lord Grey, having been led forth in all the
pomp of woe to execution, have been respited for a
couple of hours and turned into ‘Arthur’s Hall,’ to
gain what cold comfort they can from it. Then
Cobham was led forth, and Markham and Grey were
brought out to meet him. Reprieves were given&mdash;a
great shout from the assembled multitude rent
the air&mdash;and the pardoned looked at each other
and felt as if they were alive from the dead.
Raleigh saw all this performance from his prison,
and was agreeably surprised to hear that he also
was not to be executed. The Court was in the
Castle during this sensational period, and the ladies
were amusing themselves with small games such
as ‘Rise pig and go,’ and ‘One penny follow
me.’ Lady Arabella Stuart was with them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">Cruel Sentence.</div>

<p>We now come to what happened here at the
end of the Civil War, when Charles was within
Carisbrooke Castle, in the Isle of Wight. When
the Commissioners left, Hammond, who was in
charge of him, dismissed all the royal attendants.
This became known in the neighbourhood, where
the people were Royalists, and caused great indignation.
Thereupon a Captain Burleigh, a man of
good family in the island, who had been captain
of one of the King’s ships and afterwards a general
of ordnance in the army, had a drum beaten in
Newport, and called upon the people to take
arms and storm the Castle. It was a rash and
childish project, and sensible people held aloof from
it. Burleigh probably thought that he could not
be much punished, and no one had yet suffered for
treason in supporting the King. But the Parliament
took a new departure. Hammond arrested him, and
sent him a prisoner to Winchester Castle, and soon
a ferocious judge, whose name was Wild, was sent
down to condemn him. Sentence in the usual form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
was passed, and the unfortunate man sentenced to
be hanged and quartered here.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Charles himself passed a night
here on his road from Hurst Castle to Windsor,
whence he took his last journey to London. Many
of the gentry and others came to meet him, and
the Mayor and Corporation prepared an address;
but Lieutenant Cobbett warned them, and having
fresh in their memories the tragic end of poor Burleigh,
they desisted and craved forgiveness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Surrender of the Castle.</div>

<p>At no period in its history did the Castle occupy
so conspicuous a position as during the Civil War.
From 1642 to 1645, there was frequently a conflict
raging here between the red scarf and the buff.
In the first-named year it was in the neglected
state into which it had gradually fallen, and the
Cavaliers who took refuge in it, found it an inadequate
place of safety, as there were no cannon on
its walls and Waller’s troops “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">beset them with
musqueteers and Horse, and lay perdues under the
wall so that not a man of them could stir</span>.” At
eleven at night the Cavaliers sounded for a parley&mdash;in
vain&mdash;and the besiegers next morning, lacking
artillery and petards, prepared a quantity of faggots
and tar barrels to burn the Castle gate. Then
negotiations commenced, and it was agreed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Lord Grandison should surrender the Castle with all
arms, horses, and money, the garrison being granted
their lives. A scandalous scene of pillage ensued,
contrary to conditions. The men were stripped of
their clothes “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">four or five pulling at one cloak
like hounds at the leg of a dead horse</span>,” and the
officers were robbed of their purses. Waller left
Lord Grandison and some prisoners in the Castle,
under a small guard, but he found means to escape
to the King at Oxford, and suggested to Sir William
Ogle that he should try to rescue the prisoners.
Sir Richard Tichborne assisted, and in three days
they were in possession both of the Castle and of
the arms and ammunition of the enemy. Sir
William now strengthened the Castle, and made
it “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">as inaccessible as art could invent</span>,” considering
it the key to the whole Western country. He was
assisted by the Mayor and citizens, and put the
defences of the city into a better state than they
had been for years. Soon afterwards the Royalist
Western army of 3,000 Foot and 1,500 Horse
entered the town under Lord Hopton. Winchester
was generally a loyal town, but there were some
weak-kneed people there, who replied to the King
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">they could not be justly blamed for endeavouring
to secure their lives and to keep their
wives and daughters from rapine and destruction</span>.”</p>

<p>After the city had been three times plundered
by Waller it again held out for the King, and was
finally taken by Cromwell at the end of September,
1645. He advanced against it with three regiments
of infantry and 2000 cavalry. This strong force
and the memory of past defeats caused the resistance
to be half-hearted&mdash;indeed, the Mayor said
he would try to bring about a capitulation. After
the gate was fired, the Roundheads entered and
the Royalists fled to the Castle, which was soon
surrounded. Mines and batteries were immediately
commenced. “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">We have cooped up in the Castle
120 Horse and 400 Foot, and all the malignant
gentry and clergy of this Hampshire and Sussex,
with many Papists and Jesuits.</span>” Doctor Curle, the
Bishop of Winchester, remained firm to the King
on this trying occasion, and suffered accordingly.
Cromwell gave him permission to leave the city,
but he refused to accept it, and went into the
Castle with the soldiers. But next day, Thursday,
when the batteries were placed opposite the walls,
the Bishop thought he would as soon be somewhere
else, and sent to Cromwell to say he would accept
his offer. This advance was refused, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
told he would be treated as any other prisoner of
war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attack by Cromwell.</div>

<p>On Friday the battery of six guns was perfected,
and on Saturday it began to play. Lord Ogle hoisted
a red flag of defiance. Notwithstanding Cromwell’s
Puritan views, he did not make Sunday a day of rest,
nor did he keep it holy, though he intermingled
prayer and preaching with battering&mdash;firing altogether
two hundred cannon balls in the day. The Royalists
replied; sometimes firing into the High Street, which
became unsafe for passengers, and at one time making
a sally and beating the Roundheads from their guns
for the moment. But the storm proved too severe, the
red flag was carried away by a shot, and granadoes
did great execution&mdash;one breaking through into the
hall and killing three men.<a name="Anchor_27" id="Anchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a> A wide breach was
made near the “Black Tower” and the Royalists
called out “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">A parley, a parley for God’s sake! Let
us have articles! Will you not hear us for a parley?</span>”</p>

<p>We might have expected a more stubborn defence,
for the Castle was strongly fortified. If the besiegers
had entered the breach they would have had six
distinct works and a drawbridge to pass over. Moreover
victuals were abundant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Cromwell now wrote the following unctuous letter
to Fairfax:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote" lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;This is the addition of another mercy.
You see God is not weary of doing you good. I
confess, Sir, His favour to you is as visible when He
comes by His power upon the hearts of your
enemies, making them quit places of strength to you,
as when He gives courage to your soldiers to attempt
hard things. His goodness in this is much to be
acknowledged; for the Castle was well manned with
six hundred and eighty Horse and Foot, there being
near two hundred gentlemen, officers and their
servants, well victualled with 15 <abbr title="hundredweight">cwt.</abbr> of cheese, very
great store of wheat and beer, nearly 20 barrels of
powder, seven pieces of cannon; the works were
exceeding good and strong. It’s very likely it would
have cost much blood to have gained it by storm.
This is repeated to you that God may have all the
praise, for it’s all His due. Sir, I rest your most
humble servant,</p>

<p class="smcap signed letter">
“Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<p class="letter">
“<span class="smcap">Winchester</span>, <i>6th October, 1645</i>.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Cavaliers Disguised.</div>

<p>Among the spoil were three or four hogsheads of
French wines and a hundred and twelve hogsheads of
strong beer. The Cavaliers felt a natural reluctance
that all this good tipple should go down rebel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
throats, and seem to have done their best to prevent
such a calamity. The enemy were by the articles to
enter at eight on Monday morning, but the surrender
had to be delayed until after two, owing to the intoxicated
state of the garrison. “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Viscount Ogle was
as drunk as a beggar</span>,” writes an eye-witness. “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">I had
come sooner had not my Lord Ogle and his company
been so unwilling to part with their sack and strong
beer, of which they drank so liberally at their farewell
that few of them, as it is their manner, could get
up on their horses without help.</span>” The Bishop and
his chaplain came out in their long gowns and cassocks,
and were granted an escort to protect them from
insult. Dr. Curle died a few years later in poverty.</p>

<p>The Castle was conferred by Parliament on Sir
W. Waller, brother-in-law to Sir Henry Tichborne,
to whom it belonged. It had been in the Waller
family, who were connected with the Tichbornes.
Waller sold the Hall to the County and the Castle to
the Corporation of Winchester.<a name="Anchor_28" id="Anchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a></p>

<p>The Parliaments of England sat occasionally in
this Hall for four hundred years after the Conquest.
Since Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>’s reign county business has
been transacted here, and from Cromwell’s time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Law Courts have been established, the space being
divided, the upper part devoted to the Crown Court,
and the lower to Nisi Prius. Generations of judges
here shivered on the Bench, but at length a successful
demand was made that New Courts should be
constructed at the east end, and that this hall should
be only the vestibule and waiting-room. During a
long period the graceful pillars we now behold were
portly and shapeless, encased in cement a foot thick,
but in course of time the witnesses, plaintiffs, and
defendants who were kept kicking their heels here by
“the law’s delays” did some good, for they knocked
off the lower part of the cement and the marble
became visible. About fourteen years ago it was
determined to try the effect of removing the incrustation,
and the operation having proved successful on
one of the pillars near the door, the rest were soon
“translated.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Palace of Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr></div>

<p>Passing through the south door we found ourselves
beside the one remaining tower, massive in
strength and looking down from the height upon
a garden where once ran the castle moat. On
our right rises the high wall of a very different
structure&mdash;Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s red brick palace. The proportions
are magnificent and the whole effect worthy
of its great designer, Wren. The main entrance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
its six lofty pillars, acanthus-leaved capitals, and
heavy entablature surmounted by the royal arms is
scarcely visible from any point in the town, owing to
the conglomeration of houses below it, but a glimpse
can be obtained from a stable yard in Trafalgar
Street, turning out of the High Street.</p>

<p>Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> laid the first stone in 1683. Evelyn
writes in that year that the palace was estimated to
cost <abbr title="35000 pounds">£35,000</abbr>, and the surveyor was purchasing land
for a park to be ten miles in circumference. There
was to be a cupola over it visible at sea. After
Newmarket was consumed by fire, the King was more
earnest to render Winchester the seat of his autumnal
field diversions. Two years later Evelyn was here,
and observed that <abbr title="20000 pounds">£20,000</abbr> had been expended on
the palace, but his Majesty (James <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>) did not seem
to encourage the work. Queen Anne surveyed it in
person, and would have completed it for the Prince of
Denmark had he lived. The first use made of it was
for the incarceration of French prisoners of war in
1756. It must have been at that time a dreadful
place; there were sometimes as many as five thousand
prisoners in it. In 1792 it was occupied by a number
of the exiled French clergy,<a name="Anchor_29" id="Anchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a> and a few years later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
was fitted up as a barrack, for which it has been ever
since used.</p>

<p>Returning from the Castle to the Westgate we
found that the keys of the Tower were kept at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John’s Hospital at the other end of the High Street,
and that it was necessary to obtain the permission
of the civic authorities. This caused some
delay, but when I returned we entered, and,
ascending the rugged stairs, came to a cell where
prisoners were until lately confined. Proceeding
higher we reached the chamber over the arch&mdash;a
handsome room with an ancient carved mantel-piece.
The cause of the precautions taken with
regard to visitors now become intelligible; for here
are the archives of the city&mdash;volumes of records
beginning with Philip and Mary, and piles of
ancient vellum rolls. I observed a fine charter of
Elizabeth’s reign, commencing with an etched
portrait of the Queen, as a young girl, and a
grandiloquent reference to Mary and Philip, as
sovereigns of England, Scotland, France, Naples,
Jerusalem, and Ireland. The rarest of these old
documents were for a long time thought to be lost,
but when, some ten years ago, inquiry was being
made in a solicitor’s office in Peter’s Street, for a
charter of Richard <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, one of the clerks said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
“Oh, we have a box full of these old things,” showing
some parchments. And here, upon examination,
were found twenty of these ancient records!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The City Coffer.</div>

<p>In this room is the huge old city chest, nearly ten
feet long by four wide. It has three locks and
different keys, and long chains and rings by which
it could be carried about like the Ark of the
Israelites.</p>

<p>“From what we read of the propensities of the
Jews,” said Mr. Hertford, “I should say they would
have preferred such an ark as this to their own.”</p>

<p>“Well, some of them would, perhaps,” I replied.
“Their ark carried the law and holy things, but this
contained the coin, and also the gold and silver plate
of the city.”</p>

<p>It was heavily drawn upon in Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>’s reign for
the King’s benefit. On December 30, 1643, there
were taken out for the maintenance of the army:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why, the good aldermen could scarcely have left
themselves a cup for drinking the King’s health,”
observed Mr. Hertford.</p>

<p>“Nor had they much wine for that purpose,” I added.
“They had sent the King already a sum of <abbr title="1000 pounds">£1,000</abbr>,
and the Roundheads tapped them pretty freely.”</p>

<p>This large chest reminds me of another there is
at Upham, in which, when at Marwell Hall near
this, a girl playing hide-and-seek concealed herself.
She could not raise the lid, and nothing was known
about her mysterious disappearance until years afterwards
when her skeleton was found&mdash;a melancholy
treasure.</p>

<p>Passing through the gate I admired the exterior.
There was machicolation over it for giving assailants
a warm reception, perhaps because there was no ditch
in front of it. There was a moat on each side, but on
account of the difference of level, they did not meet
here. Milner says that there was part of a Saxon
chapel adhering to this building.</p>

<p>As we were about to move on, the magic of history
brought a scene before my mind. Stay! what is that
concourse and cavalcade before the gate? I hear a
voice proclaiming&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>“Let no merchant or other for these sixteen days,
within a circuit of sixteen leagues round the Fair, sell,
buy, or set out for sale, any merchandise in any place
but the Fair, under a penalty of forfeiture of goods
to the Bishop.”</p>

<p>The Mayor is presenting the keys of the gate, but
what sour countenances have he and his fellow
citizens! Is not this what took place in the fourteenth
century, on the eve of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’ fair?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Plague.</div>

<p>As it was a fine autumnal day I now strolled right
away by myself for a country walk. Just before me
was an obelisk raised to commemorate the Plague of
1666, when the markets had to be placed outside the
town. It stands upon the very stone on which
exchanges were then made, the money being dropped
into a bowl of water to avoid contagion. I saw in
large letters on the obelisk that it was erected by the
“Society of Natives,” somewhat suggestive of oysters,
or of some primitive race descended from them, but
I found the reference was to an association formed
immediately after the plague, with the benevolent
object of assisting the widows and orphans of those
who had died.</p>

<p>An old man told me that when at work in a cellar
near this, in Newburgh Street, he found, seven feet
down, about a hundred rusty old swords. He was
told they were Saxon, and that if he had sent them
to the Queen he should never have had to do another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
day’s work, “a consummation,” according to his views,
“devoutly to be wished.” Some of them were sent
to the Museum, but as I could not find them there, I
doubted whether they were really Saxon.</p>

<p>Proceeding towards the country I saw on my right
the Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s in course of construction&mdash;the
work seems to have fallen into a state of chronic
debility. It stands on the foundations of the old
Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anastasius, and this district which
seems fresh and cheerful is mostly historical from
disease. It was depopulated by a pestilence in
1348, and never until lately recovered. At the end
of the fifteenth century this church, and one with the
pleasant name of “<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s of the Valley,” were
taken down, and Wyke Chapel made the parish
church.</p>

<p>On the left I passed a red brick building, with
some handsome trees beside it. This was the Union
Workhouse&mdash;a bright, comfortable-looking edifice,
which ought to cheer the hearts of any farmers and
landowners who are thinking of soon entering it.
At the back they will find a public recreation ground,
called “Oram’s Arbour,” with seats, where they can
rest and reflect upon their past fortunes, and bless
Oram, who, having a lease of great length, generously
surrendered it on condition that the ground should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
free to the citizens for ever. There were, forty years
ago, on the western side of it, where houses have
been built, a fosse and bank, probably made by the
Royalists in Cromwell’s time, though some have
regarded them as a part of the old British defences
of the town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wyke.</div>

<p>Farther on I passed a row of cottages with brightly
flowering gardens, and after continuing up the hill
between hedges white with “travellers’ joy,” for about
half a mile, descended beneath overhanging larches,
and came to the village of Wyke, with its little boulevard
of pollard lime trees. Having obtained the
keys at an adjoining cottage, I entered the tiny
church beneath the Norman arch, and looked at the
East window, which contains bits of old glass and
has coloured scroll work round it.</p>

<p>The chapel is mentioned by Henry de Blois, but
was rebuilt in Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>’s reign. Within the
chancel is a stone in the wall about eighteen inches
square, in memory of Dr. Harpesfelde, who died in
1550. This person was a nephew of Johanna, Viscountess
Lisle, who bequeathed to him as a “scholar
of Bologna,” twelve pounds, six silver spoons, a silver
cup, and a gown. He was made by Wolsey Commissary-general
of the diocese, and assisted at the
enthronement of Gardiner. Towards the end of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
life he lived here, and went about in a horse litter.
The engraver has made his inscription conspicuous
by forming the chief letters very large and inserting
the others inside them&mdash;an early suggestion of shorthand.</p>

<p>The greater part of the present building is of
Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>’s time. There are here abundant
monuments to the Godwin family. I was somewhat
amused at one, which, after setting forth a long
catalogue of virtues, ended by bidding the exhausted
reader&mdash;“Blush, if you do not venerate the name of
Thomas Godwin.”<a name="Anchor_30" id="Anchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a></p>

<p>Just opposite the door there is in the wall a curious
little brass, about a foot high and six inches wide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Many people come to take rubbings of it. Here is
represented <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Christopher carrying the infant Christ.
The saint is wading through a stream, and in his
anxiety to behold the face of his sacred burden seems
to have dislocated his neck. The inscription beneath
runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I observed that <i>z</i> is here twice put for <i>y</i>&mdash;and the
fact reminded me of the pronunciation of the agricultural
people here.</p>

<p>As I left the quaint little sanctuary I found an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
labouring man standing outside gazing at it wistfully
in an attitude of meditation. I was glad to see this.
“The poorest,” I thought, “can appreciate the ancient
and the beautiful.” But his reflections were more
practical. As I passed he gave me a curious look,
and said, with a twinkle in his grey eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>“Richest living about Winchester, zir.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” I replied. “How much do you make
it?”</p>

<p>“Eight hundred and fifty, zir.”</p>

<p>“The rector would be glad to receive half that,”
I returned.</p>

<p>Resuming my walk I soon came in sight of a white
cylindrical building with a globular top, on the high
ground of Harestock. As I saw my agricultural
friend trudging after me I stopped to ask him about
it.</p>

<p>“What is that?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“That? Oh that is a place for looking at the
stars. It belongs to Captain Knight; he is a great
astrologer.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Littleton.</div>

<p>As I did not want my horoscope cast I passed on,
and proceeded along a hilly road between high banks,
where grew the blue scabious and long spikes of
yellow agrimony and mullein, till in two miles I
descended into the village of Littleton. The church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
has been restored and thus lost much of its interest,
but there is here a dark square font of massive stone,
by which we think we can see the immediate
descendants of the Norman invaders standing to
have their children christened. There is also a brass
on the floor in front of the chancel dating from 1493.
Opening into the churchyard is an old cottage
parsonage, in which the clergyman formerly lived
when he was&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line-1">“Passing rich on forty pounds a year.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">On one side was the large, low kitchen with its wide
hearth; on the other, the little room which was the
parson’s drawing-room, parlour, and study.<a name="Anchor_31" id="Anchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a></p>

<p>Two years ago there was a great conflagration
opposite this church, a number of cottages were
burnt, and some of the villagers had narrow escapes.</p>

<p>This is three miles from Winchester, and a mile
further on I came to Mr. Carrick Moore’s house, his
large stables for racehorses, and a field laid out with
jumps for training steeplechasers. The racecourse is
not far from this on the right. Racing has long been
a favourite amusement at Winchester. In 1634 a cup
was provided by the city; and again in 1705, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Queen Anne was here, the kindly civic chest was not
appealed to in vain. This was an improvement on
the old sport of bull-baiting, for which it had been
ordered that two Winchester butchers should provide
two or three times a year one “sufficient fighting
bull,” the other butchers contributing <abbr title="6 pence">6d.</abbr> each a year.</p>

<p>At this point there is on the left a distant view of
the woods of Mr. Vanderbyl, and passing on along
grassy banks, spangled with rock cistus, I came to a
pool at the commencement of Crawley. The village
runs up a hill, at the top of which is the church
adjacent to the beautiful grounds of Crawley Court
(Lord Kinnaird). The church is reached through
an avenue of limes: it contains some small Norman
pillars, a brass recording diffusely the virtues of a
rector named Reniger, who died in 1606, and a chest
which once performed the double service of strongbox
and communion table.</p>

<p>From this point I returned to the pool, and taking
the road to the right came in about two miles to the
woods of Lainston on the right, and a double avenue
of limes opposite the lodge of Mr. Vanderbyl. A
mile farther on a loftier avenue opens, at the end
of which stood Lainston House. I cannot say that I
saw it clearly for the sun dazzled me, setting directly
behind it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Maid of Honour.</div>

<p>Close to the house stand the ruins of Lainston
Church, picturesquely situated in dense woods. Here
one fine August morning, in 1744, the gay Miss
Chudleigh was privately married to Hervey, a naval
officer, who became third Earl of Bristol. Notwithstanding
this, and her having two children, she
continued to be called “Miss Chudleigh,” and to
be a maid of honour. George <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> affected to be in
love with her, and even went so far as to kiss her at a
party. Twenty-five years afterwards she contracted
a bigamous marriage with Pierrepont, Duke of
Kingston, which was set aside. She was a prominent
figure in Ranelagh Gardens, and her dress
seems to have harmonized with her performances.
Walpole says that on one occasion she appeared
at a masquerade as Iphigenia, but “as naked as
Andromeda.”<a name="Anchor_32" id="Anchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="image_sparsholt" id="image_sparsholt"><img src="images/sparsholt.jpg" alt="Sparsholt Church" /></a>
    <p class="caption">
       Sparsholt Church.
    </p>
</div>

<p>In this vicinity, but lying off the high road and
consequently little visited by strangers, is the
scattered village of Sparsholt, with its two inns,
one shop, and post office. It was perhaps a more
important place in ancient days, for Roman relics
have been found here. The church is small; its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
architecture varies from transitional Norman to
Perpendicular. During the late restorations the
tomb of a priest was opened, and with him were
found a chalice and paten of latten, now in the
vicar’s possession.</p>

<p>The village water supply is obtained from a well
of unusual depth. Over it is placed a large broad
wheel, and the ropes by which the buckets are
lowered and raised are coiled round what may be
called the axle. The water drawer steps on the stairs
of the wheel to raise the bucket, and if unused to the
treadmill&mdash;which no doubt these happy rustics are&mdash;must
be well tired before his efforts are crowned with
success.</p>

<p>Down the road is a stile by which one may enter
what is locally known as the “Avenue,” a lovely
piece of woodland scenery, abounding in noble
trees. Here we may pleasantly rest for a while,
and listen to the cooing of wood-pigeons or watch
squirrels at their merry gambols. Through this a
path leads to the high road, along which, past Harestock
and Wyke, we reach Winchester again.</p>

<p>Next morning we started in

down the High Street. On the left-hand side we
soon came to a curiously narrow street or alley,
running beside a large bookseller’s shop, and entering
it saw above us an immense timber-crossed gable,
leaning over so as almost to touch the opposite
houses. Further down the alley&mdash;in which the
“Royal Oak” public-house, once the “Cross Keys,”
is situated&mdash;we still see above us a line of overhanging
stories. We can walk round this block, and
return into the High Street by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s Street.</p>

<p>This building, on which is inscribed in large letters
“God-begot House,” is at present occupied by the
two establishments of Mr. Perkins, a draper, and
Miss Pamplin, a stationer. From the house of the
former the panelling has been removed, but behind
the shop is a small room with a richly stuccoed
ceiling.</p>

<p>Miss Pamplin showed us over her house with
great courtesy. The upper part is wainscoted with
oak. The drawing-room is handsome&mdash;low, of
course&mdash;and it has many beams in the ceiling,
radiating from the centre. The walls are covered
with carved panelling, the most elaborate part, over
the fireplace, exhibiting small round-headed arches
with intricate mouldings, while the opposite wall is
adorned with lines of large rosettes. The bedroom in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the roof at the back shows some curious woodwork;
from it there is a good view of the back of this old-world
edifice, with its long-tiled roofs sloping inwards
to a central court.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God-begot House.</div>

<p>This house, which dates from 1667, is large, and
let in apartments. It stands on the site of the
Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s, in Macellis&mdash;that is, in the
shambles&mdash;and was surrounded by butchers’ stalls, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Peter’s Street having been called Fleshmonger Street.
There seems to have been a house of an ecclesiastical
character, called “God-begot,” adjoining the church,
and the privileges of the spot are said to have been
originally granted by Queen Emma, the mother of
Edward the Confessor, to the Priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun.
It was a sanctuary&mdash;a place of refuge for the guilty&mdash;and
many conflicts arose about it between the civil
and ecclesiastical authorities, sometimes men being
forcibly dragged out of it. Strange to say, it was
also a manor. A record was kept here; courts were
held, and judgments delivered.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the street is the old Guildhall,
in front of which a large clock is held out over
the street by an arm of old carved wood.</p>

said Miss Hertford.</p>

<p>“If you have any fear of that,” I replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> “be
assured there is nothing in it; the case is empty, the
works being in the curfew tower above.”</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of the three swords over
it?” inquired Miss Hertford. “They remind me of
a conjuring trick.”</p>

<p>“They represent the arms of Paulet, Marquess of
Winchester,” I replied; “to whom the small fee farm-rent
of the city, once belonging to the Crown, is still
paid. The most remarkable thing about this clock
is that it is very troublesome, as like other old timepieces,
it requires to be wound up every day.”</p>

<p>The old Guildhall was behind the figure of Queen
Anne on the first floor, the ground floor belonging
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s Hospital. This division preserved the
fine oak staircase to the hall, which necessarily led up
from a side street. We went up these stairs, and
Miss Hertford observed they were in a very dirty
condition, but, as our guide said they were used
every day for winding and lighting the clock,
and ringing the bell in the curfew tower,<a name="Anchor_33" id="Anchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a> we were
not much surprised. The panelling in the old
Guildhall has been removed to the new one. No
mayor and aldermen now sit here in state, but there
are plenty of gowns, robes, and collars, for the hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
has been formed into the show-rooms of Mr. King’s
drapery establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Butter Cross.</div>

<p>The next object that claims our attention is the
Butter Cross. It dates from the reign of Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>,
when a fraternity employed themselves in erecting
such structures. If we recall past times we shall
picture to ourselves here a motley crowd of market
people intermixed with brethren of the cord and
gown, and shall hear much noisy bargaining going
forward. Later on, about 1650, we find a more
stately gathering. The guild of merchants were to
meet the Mayor every Sunday here to accompany
him to church. This would seem to have been a
compulsory, rather than a voluntary, meeting, and
about seventy years earlier we find people imprisoned
for not attending “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">sermonds</span>.”</p>

<p>“It is to be regretted that this disinclination continues,”
said Miss Hertford, “but those who frequent
the afternoon services at cathedrals, cannot fail to
observe the desire there is to hear the anthem and
avoid the discourse.”</p>

<p>In a sketch of this Cross, made in the year 1770,<a name="Anchor_34" id="Anchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a>
we find the upper niches vacant. The only ancient
figure is that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Laurence, who holds what appears
to be a sword, but is in reality intended for a palm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
branch. This Cross was sold by the City Corporation
to Mr. Dummer, in the middle of the last century, and
was in danger of being removed (as the Bristol Cross
actually was); but the good people of Winchester
rose indignantly when they heard of the intended sacrilege,
forcibly drove away the men engaged to do
the objectionable work.</p>

<p>Under the passage which leads from the Cross to
the “Square” is the door to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence’s Church,
a building curiously inserted among houses. It reminds
us of the way in which Winchester was in
olden times honey-combed with churches and
chapels. This is considered to be the mother
church of Winchester, the bishop is inducted here,
and goes into the tower to ring the bell. Most of
the present edifice is modern, but the tower and east
window are of the fifteenth century. Opposite the
entrance to this church is a piece of Norman stone-work
with some ornamental carving upon it&mdash;the
only specimen of the domestic architecture of that
date in Winchester&mdash;perhaps a part of the palace
built here by William the Conqueror, which extended
up this side of the High Street,<a name="Anchor_35" id="Anchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a> and across to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Minster Street and Lane. The foundations of an
ancient tower of “prodigious strength” were found
at the beginning of the present century by a workman
digging in Market Street.</p>

<p>We are now close to the “Square” where the
Saxon palace probably stood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Name of England.</div>

<p>The Saxon period was in one respect the most
remarkable in Winchester, for the city was then the
capital of Wessex, and Wessex became the mother
of England. We read in the old chroniclers that
Egbert was crowned in Winchester Cathedral the
first King of England, and that at a Witenagemot or
parliament, held by him here in the year 800, it was
determined that the name of England should supersede
that of Britain. Egbert was the first who
united the kingdoms of the heptarchy, and the
probability that he changed the name is increased
by the fact that “Anglia,” which is nowhere found
in any document anterior to this time, begins to
appear immediately afterwards.<a name="Anchor_36" id="Anchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred the Great.</div>

<p>But the principal figure that the Saxon palace at
Winchester brings before us, is that of Alfred. He
deserved the title of Great better than many who
obtained it, for he was not only victorious in battle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
but was essentially a scholar&mdash;indeed his successes
were mainly the result of his study and industry. A
shade of melancholy seems always to have hung over
his mind, perhaps due to his constant physical suffering,
though he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line_i8">“To those who eat</div>
    <div class="p_line">Honeycomb it seems more sweet,</div>
    <div class="p_line">If a man before the tear</div>
    <div class="p_line">Of honey, taste of bitter cheer.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the following lines there is a touch of sadness
worthy of the author of Ecclesiastes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">

    <div class="p_line_i2">Wealth may take wing?”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Many are accustomed to speak despondingly of
the degeneracy of the nineteenth century, but it
sounds strange to hear Alfred condemning the luxury
of his time, which we generally regard as semi-civilized.
He looks back regretfully to the good old
days:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We may picture Alfred living in his palace here,
surrounded by this rude magnificence, but with
a mind far above its allurements. His life corroborated
the saying that religion is best for both
worlds. Perhaps his devotional tendencies came
from his father, who had been a monk. He ever
consorted with learned men, and made great improvements,
among others rendering his fleet more
efficient. There was great joy in Winchester in
899 when, after a sea fight between the Saxons and
Danes, two of the marauders’ ships were captured,
and the crews brought here to the King, and hanged
on the gallows.</p>

<p>A copy of an ancient charter giving property to
the church of Evesham is interesting, as it shows
Rufus here in 1100, surrounded by the bishops of
London, Lincoln, and Durham, the abbots of Westminster
and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Albans, the Chancellor, and many
other barons of the whole of England, at the solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
feast of Easter.<a name="Anchor_37" id="Anchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a> It was from this that Rufus started
on his unfortunate expedition into the New Forest.</p>

<p>It is supposed that somewhere in the neighbourhood
of the Conqueror’s palace were the mint and
treasury. It is said that the six mints established
by Athelstan were under the site of the Penthouse.<a name="Anchor_38" id="Anchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a>
As I had heard of some vaults remaining which
I could not find, I went into one of the shops there
to inquire.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” replied the owner, “I have some
doubts whether there ever was any mint here; but,”
he added, with a comical expression, “I am quite
certain there is none now.”</p>

<p>The site of the “Penthouse” was originally occupied
by the “Draperie.” Trade guilds existed here
from Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>’s time, and this became the Guildhall.
Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> ordered that this Draperie Street should
be the “Great Street,” as in the time of his father.
In Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>’s reign we find the Penthouse mentioned
as the “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Pentisse</span>.”</p>

<p>“Such shelters were very welcome a hundred years
ago,” said Mr. Hertford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> “before umbrellas were used.
You know that some have thought that in ‘under the
rose,’ the word should be ‘rows.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Murder by a Priest.</div>

<p>“Close to this,” I continued, “beside the wall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Lawrence’s Church, a murder took place, in the
twenty-first year of Richard <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, which brings before
us the lawless state of the times. One James Dyngeley,
a priest, struck a man named Walter Pynchon,
through the back to the heart with a baslard. This
weapon was a large dagger suspended to the girdle,
and worn by laymen and by some priests, notwithstanding
an ecclesiastical prohibition. Roger, the
parson of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence, claimed the prisoner (as an
ecclesiastic) for the Bishop of Winchester, and he
was incarcerated in Wolvesey Castle. From this he
broke out with others on the 5th of December, in
the fifth year of Henry <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>, but was pardoned by
the King for this and other felonies&mdash;a proof of the
influence of the Church in those days.”<a name="Anchor_39" id="Anchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a></p>

<p>The next church we come to is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maurice’s, which
is modern, the fifteenth-century tower has a good
Norman doorway looking towards the Cathedral.
There are some old registers belonging to this church
which record the burials of men killed in the Soke
(across the bridge), fighting with the Roundheads in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the days of Cromwell. There is a monument here
in which the admirers of William Widmore have
made him ridiculous for ever, by calling him “a
friend without guile, and an apothecary without
ostentation;” the less excusable, as they say he was
“an honest Englishman.”</p>

<p>Opposite this church is a passage leading to the
“Bell and Crown.” A hostel of that name has stood
here ever since Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr>’s reign. The building now
on the spot is old, and has been evidently much
altered. The wall of the staircase is spotted over
with a small blue pattern.</p>

<p>“I thought there was a paper on the wall,” said the
landlord, “and was going to have another put over
it; but a gentleman said to me, ‘Do no such thing.
Why, that is stencilled! there is not another house
in Winchester can show such decoration.’”</p>

<p>Stencilling was much used in the last century.</p>

<p>“I have heard,” said Mr. Hertford, “that the
celebrated Miss Mellon (Duchess of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Albans) went
about when young with her father and a company of
actors who, as occasion offered, acted plays and
stencilled rooms.”</p>

<p>The work is performed by placing against the wall
a thin piece of metal on which a pattern has been
cut, and then brushing paint over it. This ornamentation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
is interesting, as showing the transition
from frescoes and panelling to paper-hangings.</p>

<p>The passage in front of the “Bell and Crown”
was formerly a large archway, on the eastern side
of which there was a hall for entertainments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="image_guildhall" id="image_guildhall"><img src="images/guildhall.jpg" alt="The Guildhall" /></a>
    <p class="caption">
       The Guildhall.
    </p>
</div>

<p>The new Guildhall is a handsome and conspicuous
modern building, and stands on the site of the old
Globe Hotel. Adjoining it is the Free Library&mdash;one
of the first established in England. There are some
old pictures in the Council Chamber, especially one
of Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, by Sir P. Lely, given by that monarch
to the Corporation. There is also one of the first
Marquess of Winchester&mdash;a piece of painted board
which may teach some worldly wisdom. William
Paulet was made a peer by Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>, a marquess
by Edward <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>, and was High Treasurer under Mary
and Elizabeth. How did he accomplish all this?
“By being a willow, not an oak.”<a name="Anchor_40" id="Anchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">[40]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Museum.</div>

<p>I mounted the staircase to visit the Museum, which
is at the top of the building. The greater part of
the treasures it contains are “prehistoric,” and lent
by Lord Northesk during his life. There is here one
of the finest collections in existence of stone axes and
arrow heads, and specimens from barbarous countries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of our own day, showing how they were hafted and
fastened with sinews or matting.</p>

<p>But I felt more interested in the local antiquities.
Here is a Roman pavement, found at the corner of
Minster Lane, about a hundred yards in front of the
west gate of the Cathedral. It is only a segment, and
the preservation of it cost <abbr title="300 pounds">£300</abbr>, which may account
for other remains of this kind being allowed to perish.
The depth at which it was found was ten feet, so that
we may conclude it was laid down soon after the
Romans arrived, unless some accidental circumstances
led to accumulations over it. The specimens
of Roman pottery show us the extent of their town
here, for some pieces were found in Water Lane, just
over the eastern bridge, while others were dug up in
Hyde Street, on the extreme north-west of the city.</p>

<p>Opposite these remains we find a brave row of
weights and measures&mdash;standard measures for England
were first introduced by Edgar at Winchester.
Some good citizens maintain with pardonable vanity
that one of Edgar’s measuring vessels is still here,
but that is not the case. I hoped to be able to hang
a story on one of the pegs that good king had put
in the Saxon cups; but no material proof of his
precautions to prevent tippling or cheating remains.
The existing measures date from Henry <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
There is his bushel&mdash;a great bronze basin, bearing
his name, with an emblematic Lancastrian rose. At
the one extremity of a yard measure I found the
letter H, at the other E, which I attributed to Henry
and Elizabeth of York, who were certainly at opposite
ends of the stick, but I was informed that E
stood for the Tudor Elizabeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Archives.</div>

<p>In glass frames are displayed some of the archives
of the city. Here is a photo of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s charter
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">civibus meis Wint.</span>,” 1160; it has been said that there
was an earlier one. The terms are general, and the
contractions numerous and puzzling to the uninitiated&mdash;the
whole being comprised in a piece of
vellum not six inches square. The writing, which
was clear in those days, contrasts here with some
spidery cacography of later age.</p>

<p>This charter raised the Mayor of Winchester above
all other civic officials in England. But at Richard
<abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>’s coronation a dispute arose between the mayors of
London and Winchester as to which should be Butler,
and which Clerk of the Kitchen&mdash;the former being
the higher office. The decision was in favour of
London, but in compensation the King gave Winchester
a very liberal charter.</p>

<p>In a list of ancient usages of Winchester, which
existed earlier than the thirteenth century, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
this document recording them was written, we find
ordinances about various trades&mdash;the “<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">bakere</span>” and
the “<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">brewstere of myste</span>” are specially mentioned.</p>

<p lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">“Also everych bakere of ye town that maketh
bred to sale shal to the kynge of custome <abbr title="11 shillings">11s.</abbr> the
year and to the clerk of the town a peny.” It goes
on to say that he is to make good white bread, and
if the weight is deficient, is to be at the King’s mercy.</p>

<p lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">“And also everych cart out of fraunchyse comyng
in to town with samown, shal to the kynge of custome
thre pens.</p>

<p lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">“Also everych cart out of the fraunchyse shal
to the kynge by custome 11 pens and an hafpeny
what ffyshe he here to sale. And everych horse
berdene of fresh fysh that cometh in to the town
to sale and be out of franchyse shal to the kynge
thre hafpens of custome and of shalt fysh a hafpeny.”</p>

<p>The monopolies granted in Winchester to trades
unions were considerable. In 1580 no cobbler was
allowed to make “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">shoes, boots, buskins, skertoppes,
slippers or pantaples</span>;” he was not only to stick to his
last, but to confine himself to repairs. Any infringement
of this rule involved a penalty of <abbr title="6 shillings 8 pence">6s. 8d.</abbr> a pair.
Each trade was to carry on its own business&mdash;no
intruders allowed. In 1673 a man paid money to be
permitted to live in the city, and in 1728 a barber had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to pay to be allowed to carry on his business. In
1656 it was resolved that the election of the mayor
and aldermen should be by “bullets.” This sounds
alarming; but the order is that one hundred red and
white bullets, in equal proportions, shall be provided,
and that the electors shall put them in privately.</p>

<p>A copy of the letter Cromwell sent to the Mayor
summoning the town to surrender is preserved here.
It runs thus:</p>

<div class="quote" lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">
<p>“Sir,&mdash;I come not to this city but with a full
resolution to save it and the inhabitants thereof from
ruine. I have commanded the Souldyers upon payne
of death that noe wrong bee done; wch I shall strictly
observe, only I expect you give me entrance into the
City, without necessitating mee to force my way,
which yf doe then it will be in my power to save
you or it. I expect yor answeare with in halfe an
houre, and rest, your servant,</p>

<p  class="smcap signed letter">“Oliver Cromwell.”</p>
</div>

<p>It will be observed that by some oversight or
waggish design the word “not” has been omitted
before “in my power.”</p>

<p>A modern, but not uninteresting object here is a
large model of the Cathedral, carved in wood with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
jack-knife, by a shepherd’s boy, while tending sheep
on the Hampshire Downs. It was presented to Dean
Garnier in his 92nd year.</p>

<p>We were much pleased with the young lady in
charge of this collection, who does her best to answer
all the difficult questions put to her. She told us
that her father was an antiquary, and half ruined
himself in publishing archæological works, but that
she was not sorry for it. How refreshing to hear
such disinterested sentiments in these grasping days!
Her grandfather was a brewer, and she was glad she
had none of the money he made in such an objectionable
trade.</p>

<p>Just below the Guildhall, on the east, stands a
modern brick building, with two towers, named the
Abbey House&mdash;recalling memories of the celebrated
nunnery which stood here. It was founded by
Alfred’s queen, Ælwitha, who resided here as a
widow. Edburga, his granddaughter, also lived here
and carried her humility so far as to wash the nuns
clothes secretly, much to the increase of their faith.
The church of the Abbey had a lofty tower.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s Hospital.</div>

<p>A little lower down we find two buildings facing
each other on either side of the street. The southernmost
and more picturesque of the two is the more
modern, and only dates from 1833, previous to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
a draper’s shop occupied the site. Both belong to
one foundation&mdash;due, it is said, to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Birinus&mdash;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John’s Hospital. The northern establishment (on
the left) has a little old chapel, built in the days of
Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> As you enter by the gate you see in the
east end of the chapel wall, very high up, an ancient
carving of a head surrounded by a rim; but whether
meant for a nimbus or a charger, and whether representing
Our Lord or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, I leave for others to
decide.</p>

<p>We find in the Black Book that there were, during
Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>’s reign, the following sculptures in alabaster
in the hospital:&mdash;A head of John the Baptist,
two images of the same saint and two of Our Lady.
Milner writes: “In the dusthole near the apartments
of the widows, amongst other curious antiques,
is seen the figure of John the Baptist’s head in a dish,
being the bust of the holy patron of the house, which
formerly stood over the principal doorway.”</p>

<p>The court of the hospital is laid out in beautiful
swards and beds of flowers and the houses seem to be
pleasant residences. Before 1852 the land belonged
to the Mildmay family, and then the hospital had
only six poor cottages. Some arches are visible and
stairs going down into a kind of kitchen from which
an arch, still visible, communicated with another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
kitchen or refectory. If we pass through the chapel
by the west door we find two Decorated windows
(Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>), and enter the building containing this
old chamber with a low arch and two large hearths.
The hall is over the refectory and is a room of magnificent
proportions, having its walls beautifully
stuccoed with festoons of flowers. This would appear
to date from the time of Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, whose picture,
now in the Guildhall, was formerly here.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s became the property of the Knights
Templar, and on their suppression John Devenish
refounded it for lame soldiers, poor pilgrims, and
necessitous wayfarers. He had a charitable feeling
towards the footsore. After Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>’s confiscation
it was used for meetings of the Corporation.
We learn from the Black Book that in the 38th
Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> the supper was to be kept at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John’s as amply as heretofore. On the Sunday next
following the Nativity of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Baptist, the
Mayor was to find a capon and so was the alderman
of the High Street. In order to keep the “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">banket</span>”
up to the mark each of the benchers was to pay <abbr title="12 pence">12d.</abbr>,
and each of the “Twenty four” <abbr title="8 pence">8d.</abbr>, whether they were
present or not.</p>

<p>This establishment had been confiscated by Henry
<abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>, and the buildings made over to the Corporation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
for the formation of a new hall. Various references
seem to show that this chamber was now being slowly
completed. In 21st year of Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> John Brown
was to have a certain tenement in the hold of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John’s upon condition of his giving twenty shillings
towards building a new chimney there; and in 1560 the
Mayor of Winchester who had been guilty of riding
to Southampton without a servant,<a name="Anchor_41" id="Anchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 41.">[41]</a> and of committing
other enormities, was ordered to glaze the west
window of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s Hall. This was not the present
hall, for it has no window looking west, and the
chimney was differently placed. To mend windows
seems to have been here a common and useful civic
punishment.</p>

<p>I may here observe that the clerk who entered the
civic transactions in the Black Book added a new
saint to the calendar for he generally calls this hospital
that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jones.</p>

<p>The High Street here becomes very broad, apparently
to accommodate a Russian gun, but really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
because the Bridewell and a “dye house” stood here
till the beginning of this century, when it was
removed to Hyde Street. Even the ponderous cannon
has not had a quiet time since it came here, but has
been on its travels. It was first placed where it now
stands, but a few years ago the Corporation conceived
the idea of moving it to a more commanding position
on the summit of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’ hill. They accordingly
carried it up, but immediately afterwards a tumultous
assembly, aided, it is said, by some officers, and not
dissimilar from that which saved the Butter Cross,
dragged the gun down again by might and placed it
on the site it now occupies.<a name="Anchor_42" id="Anchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a></p>

<p>Close to the bridge on the left-hand side where
are Mr. Dance’s house and grounds, stood anciently
the Dominican friary, founded by De la Roche, with
its “Elysian garden.” Just here was also the
Eastgate, a high castellated building, which must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
have formed a handsome entrance to the town in
this direction. It was removed at the end of the last
century.</p>

<p>Beneath Bridge Street are the remains of a
many-arched bridge said to have been built by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Swithun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Soke Bridge.</div>

       Soke Bridge.
    </p>
</div>

<p>Passing over Soke Bridge, and proceeding straight
on, we came, in a few hundred yards, to a public-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
built of wood and apparently sinking under the weight
of years, but which bore the name of “The Rising
Sun.” Through the open door I saw beams and
passages of ancient irregularity, and as the landlady,
a bright looking woman, was standing just inside I
asked her whether she knew anything of the history
of the house which bore such proofs of antiquity.</p>

<p>“You <i>would</i> say it was old,” she replied, “if you
saw the vaults there are downstairs.”</p>

<p>I answered that we were strangers, and should like
to see them. She speedily lighted a candle and led
the way down into a chamber about twenty feet
square and eight high. A wide flight of broken stairs
led up to the street, while on the other side of the
vault was an arch with a square window on either
side leading to a chamber beyond. There had
evidently been stone mullions and iron bars&mdash;the
irons of the door hinges remain.</p>

<p>This was the prison of the Soke belonging to the
Bishop of Winchester, and in ancient times the stocks
stood just outside. I expressed the interest I took in
these remains of the past.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied our guide, who was not quite
so visionary, “and it is a nice place for keeping beer
barrels&mdash;it is so cool.”</p>

<p>This part of the town was called the Soke, not, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
at first supposed, because of its low position near
the river, but from the Saxon <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">soc</i> or liberty, which
instead of signifying that the people here were
unusually free, meant that the Bishop of Winchester
had license to do whatever he liked to them.
Nearly opposite this establishment are some new
houses, and when their foundations were being laid,
a Roman urn was found, sixteen feet beneath the
ground.</p>

</div>

<p>Continuing our walk we made our
way up the hill, now terraced and
tastefully planted. Less than ten
years ago it was covered with little garden allotments
belonging to the citizens. On reaching the upper
ground&mdash;a sort of down&mdash;a magnificent view opened
over the whole of Winchester. We walked over to the
south-east corner, and took up our position on a seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
close to the iron fence. From there we could take a
general survey. In a hollow about two miles to the
east we saw the trees about Chilcombe; on the summit
of the down due east was a clump of trees on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Catherine’s hill; a square tower more to the north on
the lower ground was that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cross; from this
approaching Winchester, first comes the college, then
the old walls of Wolvesey, then the Cathedral, the
best and most compact view of it. Nearly over the
College on the top of the hill is the clump of firs on
the site of Cromwell’s battery, looking lower than our
position, but really being higher, and over the
Cathedral is the long red brick front of Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s
palace. Truly, we have here Winchester in a nutshell.</p>

<p>In a description of the prospect from this point,
written a hundred and fifty years since, mention is
made of the beautiful gardens, and in prints dated
1723 and 1736 we find that two-thirds of the space
within the walls of Winchester were laid out for
horticulture and adorned with large trees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fair.</div>

<p>Passing over to the northern side of the down we
came to a burial ground. The grave-digger told us
that in the southern and older part of it, he was often
obstructed by the foundations of the old chapel&mdash;that
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles,<a name="Anchor_43" id="Anchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a> a hermit saint whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
shrine is always outside mediæval cities. Hard by,
an old farm-house still exists called Palm Hall, a
corruption of Pavilionis Aula&mdash;the tent used by the
judges at the famous fair which was held here annually
at the end of August. This fair extended round this
point and southwards even down the slope and was
the greatest but one in England. We find, in the
<cite class="plain">Close Rolls</cite>, King John giving directions that wax,
pepper, and cinnamon, should be here bought for him;
and Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> (15) commands the sheriffs of Gloucestershire
and Worcestershire to allow wares to be
brought to this fair, and at another time orders that
the barons (freemen?) should proceed to Winton with
their merchandise, and not fear the hostility of the
Earl of Salisbury.<a name="Anchor_44" id="Anchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a> Guards were placed as well as
toll collectors upon the roads for seven leagues round,
within which circuit and at Southampton no business
was allowed. The right of holding the fair was
granted by Rufus to Bishop Walkelin for three
days in the year to assist him in building the
Cathedral, and the time was gradually extended,
till in Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s reign it lasted sixteen days. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Bishop had the jurisdiction, and the tolls went to
the priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun, Hyde Abbey, and other
places.</p>

<p>Now let us enter the fair. There is a palisading
all round it and only two gates. It looks something
between an industrial exhibition and a cattle show.
Each kind of ware has a separate locality. Here is
the “Draperie” and the “Pottery”&mdash;there is the
“Spicery.” Here is the street of the “Flemings,”
“Limoges,” and “Genoese,” and other nations. Even
the Bishop has a stall. There are birds, apes,
ferrets, and bears. Here are the dynamiters&mdash;dreadful
name&mdash;very harmless people, vendors of brass
pots. Moving among all these we picture to ourselves
a number of foreign merchants in rich costumes,
Jews in strange hats, the Bishop’s officials in gay
liveries, and a crowd of hard-featured, bare-footed
peasants.</p>

<p>At sunset the Marshal rides through the fair and
orders all stalls to be closed. No one is to have any
fire at night except a lamp or mortar. The justiciaries
seem to have had some good privileges. They
might enter at what day or hour they pleased into
the city, and taste one by one all the casks of wine
for sale there. They might also send their servants
to take loaves from all the bakers and bring them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to the pavilion. There they were weighed, and if
short, woe betide the baker! his bread was forfeited,
and he himself fined or put in the pillory. The tolls
seemed heavy on fancy articles. A load of hay or
corn was only <abbr title="a halfpenny">½d.</abbr>, and a cask of wine or a cart-load
of fish or leather <abbr title="4 pence">4d.</abbr>, but an ape or falcon or
bear was also <abbr title="4 pence">4d.</abbr></p>

<p>The fair continued down till about twenty years
since. The neighbouring Magdalen or “Morn” fair
lasted four years longer. Dean Kitchin writes: “As
the city grew stronger and the fair weaker, it slid
down <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’ hill and entered the town where its
noisy ghost still holds revel once a year.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Execution.</div>

<p>On the brow of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’ hill, Waltheof, Earl of
Northumberland, was beheaded by order of the
Conqueror. He had conspired with some other
Saxons against the Norman invaders, and was
betrayed by his wife&mdash;a niece of William’s.</p>

<p>At dawn he was conducted through the city from
the Castle, “arrayed in all the badges of his earl’s
rank.” After distributing memorial gifts to a few of
his friends who accompanied him, he was engaged in
prayer so long that the executioners became tired and
told him to hasten. He then begged to be allowed
to say the Lord’s prayer, but, being overcome and
halting in the middle of it, the headsman would wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
no longer and the axe fell. It was said that after his
head was off it finished the sentence, “Deliver us from
evil.” This probably was thought by those who were
surprised to see the lips move, as they often do, after
decapitation.<a name="Anchor_45" id="Anchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a></p>

<h2>THIRD DAY.</h2>

<p class="summary">The City
Walls &mdash; Danemead &mdash; Eastgate &mdash; Northgate &mdash; Westgate &mdash; Southgate &mdash; Kingsgate &mdash; The
College &mdash; Wykeham &mdash; Wolvesey &mdash; Raleigh.
</p>

<p>From the Roman occupation, and perhaps from an
earlier date, Winchester has been a fortified town.
Long after that time, people were slow in laying to
heart the saying in Plutarch that a city which contains
men who can fight has no need of walls.</p>

<p>The modern defences seem to have been chiefly
raised in the time of John and Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>,<a name="Anchor_46" id="Anchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a> just before
Winchester ceased to be the royal city of England.
In the first year of John an inexpensive way was
discovered of obtaining land to make the fosse.
Andrew Clerk, of Winchester, gladly gave ground
for the purpose, on condition that he should have
confiscated lands “which had belonged to Aaron the
Jew, in Shortenestret, and a messuage near it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
which Bona the Jewess lived.”<a name="Anchor_47" id="Anchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">[47]</a> In the patents
during Henry’s reign “<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">murage</span>,” that is, money for
wall-building, is often mentioned.<a name="Anchor_48" id="Anchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">[48]</a></p>

<p>We now pass down the High Street in the same
direction that we took yesterday, and, after reaching
the site of the Eastgate, cross the bridge, as we cannot
walk close to the river on the western side. We pass
down Water Lane, where a Roman urn was discovered
a short time since; and, crossing the river by
the mill, come to Durngate Terrace, marking the site
of a postern in the walls. This gate was made for
foot passengers in 1259. It was ordered to be
entirely closed during the plague in 1603, whence we
conclude this was a squalid part of the town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Danemead.</div>

<p>Thence as we proceeded up the City Road we found
the modern walls largely studded with pieces of old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
cut stone. The foundations of the city walls ran
close to the houses on our right, and a gentleman we
met told us that during some excavations he had seen
a part of them uncovered six feet in thickness. On
the left we soon came to Trinity Church, a handsome
new structure, and on the right, beside Newman’s the
grocer’s, there is a gate leading to some sheds in the
famous meadow called Danemead. Farther on we
found a turning on the right, and walking up it a few
yards came to the Steam Laundry, which stands on
the western edge of this field. Sceptics maintain
that Dane is a corruption of Dene, and signifies low-lying
ground, but we cannot afford to give up the old
story. Tradition says that here Athelstan sat on the
city wall to see the combat between Guy, Earl of
Warwick, and the gigantic Dane, Colbrand: Rudborne
luxuriates in the conflict, and records all the
mighty cuts and blows and their results with as much
detail as if he were a Homer or a reporter at a
modern prize fight.</p>

<p>But there seems about the whole affair much
hollowness and “sounding brass.” Guy cuts off Colbrand’s
head, and the Danes, seeing their champion
dead, run away, and are pursued. We wonder
whether Rudborne had been reading about David
and Goliath. He was a monk of Winchester in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
fifteenth century, and as he says that Colbrand’s
axe was laid up before the high altar, and could
in his day be seen in the vestry of the Cathedral, so
we may assume there was here some celebrated Dane
of the name of Colbrand.</p>

<p>Further up the City Road the deep fosse before the
walls can be traced in the slope of “Hyde Abbey
Bowling Green,” and in the garden of a ladies school
called Fossedyke House. In the centre of the cross
roads here formed by Jewry Street, Hyde Street, and
the City Road, stood the Northgate. This structure
was at length considered, as Temple Bar has been in
our times, to be a hindrance to traffic. Some people
went so far as to say that their lives had been
endangered by carriages when crossing its narrow
bridge. Purchasers of hay and straw said that the
arches of the North and South gates were so low that
they could not obtain a full load for their money.
Antiquaries have never been able to offer much
resistance to commercial interests, and so in 1771
an order was made for the removal of the time-honoured
obstacles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Towers of the Wall.</div>

<p>The foundations of the walls now cross the road
and run on our left, a fragment of them behind
Westbury Villa can still be seen from the street; and
if we look upwards we shall observe among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
branches of the trees a round tower, which a patriotic
citizen, Mr. Budden, has built to mark the foundations
of one of the towers of the wall.<a name="Anchor_49" id="Anchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">[49]</a> We now
pass down Sussex Street, and turning to the left
and then right, enter Tower Street. At the end of
the last century the picturesque ruins of the wall,
among shrubs and ash trees, ran here on the right to
the Westgate. Passing through the gate, already
described, we make for the barracks, where the Castle
formed part of the city wall; and, crossing the railway,
walk in front of the pretty gardens and houses of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
James’ Terrace, and just before recrossing the line see
the entrance to the new cemetery on our right.</p>

<p>Then we proceed down <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’ Lane (called
sometimes Barnes Lane), at the end of which in
Southgate Street, just beyond <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’ Church,
stood, till 1771, the Southgate with its bridge. The
city wall then ran down between <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun Street
and Canon Street. Some portions of it three feet
thick can still be seen about four yards behind the
cottages, half way down the northern side of the
latter street. There was formerly a postern for the
friary somewhere here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="image_kingsgate" id="image_kingsgate"><img src="images/kingsgate.jpg" alt="King’s Gate" /></a>
    <p class="caption">
       King’s Gate.
    </p>
</div>

<p>The Kingsgate is an interesting relic. There is a
little chapel (to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun) over it, as there was over
the Northgate and Eastgate. In the porter’s lodge,
at the entrance to the close, the city wall can be seen
over six feet thick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Excommunication.</div>

<p>The Kingsgate was the scene of some remarkable
events in the middle of the thirteenth century.
Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> wished to appoint the uncle of the Queen
to the bishopric of Winchester, but the monks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
sturdily refused. For five years the conflict lasted&mdash;the
chapter suffered stripes, imprisonment, and
starvation while insisting that William de Raley and
no other should be the bishop. But when this prelate
came to Winchester at Christmas he found the city
gates closed against him. He made a circuit of the
walls barefoot, and at last stopped at Kingsgate, the
nearest point to the Cathedral, and there “preaching”
pronounced a general interdict and excommunication
upon all the Cathedral and Church authorities, the
Mayor, bailiffs, and clerks, and others, who opposed
his entrance. He then withdrew to France, but was
soon afterwards received to his diocese in peace.
Fifteen years after this occurrence there was a rebellion
in Winchester against the clerical and other
governing bodies, and in the tumult the Kingsgate
was partly burnt, and some of the servants of the
monastery were murdered.</p>

<p>At this time the chapel over the gate was destroyed,
but the whole was soon afterwards restored. The
chapel in which service is now performed was rebuilt
at a later date.</p>

<p>Beside the gate of the precincts a “Druidical”
monolith can be seen placed upright in the ground.
Passing back through the Kingsgate we can see the
line of the wall continuing along the little garden of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the head-master, and here is a pretty bit for the
artist.<a name="Anchor_50" id="Anchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nearly opposite we saw a number of college boys
streaming into a small confectioner’s shop. Inside
sat a young lady in a cage. I had always felt that
the fair possessed potent charms, but I never before
knew of one who was obliged to be protected in this
way. We soon learned, however, that the wire was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
put up for the preservation of other sweets, and
because some of the boys had been studying Dr.
Smiles’ work on “Self-help.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sustern Spytal.</div>

<p>On the same side we came to one of the College
houses, with an iron railing in front of it; this
was the site of the ancient nunnery,<a name="Anchor_51" id="Anchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">[51]</a> the Sustern
Spytal. Here were afterwards the “Commoners,” or
boys not on the foundation, and now are class-rooms.
It has been said that there was no fosse along this
part of the city wall; but in the French map of
1650, one is marked as existing. The question is
doubtful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wykeham.</div>

<p>And now we arrive at the famous College, and,
as in duty bound, pay a passing tribute to its
founder. Wykeham was of yeoman birth, of comely
person, and had a strain of noble blood in him, from
his mother’s family. He was educated at a little old
school on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’ slope, which boasted that it
had numbered among its pupils Athelwolf and
Alfred the Great. No doubt, he attended to his
lessons, for we find him while still a youth,
appointed to be secretary to the Governor of the
Castle. This was the happy accident in Wykeham’s
life; without it, though he had a genius for architecture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and geometry, and was a rare draughtsman,
he might have remained in obscurity. The governor,
De Scures, knew Bishop Edington&mdash;himself
a builder&mdash;and both knew the King. They introduced
Wykeham to him, and from that moment,
at twenty-three years of age, his career was assured.</p>

<p>“He was one of those men,” observed Mr. Hertford,
“whom fortune carries to the top of the ladder
without asking them to walk up the rounds.”</p>

<p>“So it appears,” I continued. “He took, as many
of his day, the priest’s office that he might eat
a piece of bread, and soon had it richly buttered.
Not only did he become ‘a pretty considerable
pluralist’ and a bishop, he was also made Surveyor
of the King’s castles and palaces, Keeper of the
Privy Seal, Secretary to the King, and Chancellor.
In short, he was the leading spirit in the country,
and ‘everything was done by him, and without
him nothing.’”</p>

<p>“But I have read somewhere that he had a fall,”
said Mr. Hertford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> “and was obliged to appeal to
Alice Perrers. Imagine the grave bishop in his
long robes, bowing down to Edward’s impudent little
favourite! Perhaps his words were golden on this
occasion, for she said she would go and see whether
a spark of love for her remained in the old king.
And the spark did remain, and its light was sufficient
to guide Wykeham back to his temporalities.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I replied, “that story has been questioned,
but, at any rate, he only wanted his own, and
that for a good purpose. His pet college was in
danger of suffering, and though the building was
not commenced he had appointed a warden and
scholars. When the college was finished, he began
the transformation of the Cathedral and had done
good work upon it before he closed his eyes. He
left 2,500 marks to carry it on. Until the last few
years of his life he planned everything himself, and
employed no architect. He is considered to be the
father of the Perpendicular style, and was national
as opposed to Papal in his architecture and his
politics. Altogether he laid out upon building
what would now be equal to half a million. For
such brilliant success, learning and integrity were
indispensably requisite, and he summed up his
estimate of them in his famous motto ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">Manners
makyth man</span>.’”</p>

<p>Beneath the great and good deeds of Wykeham,
we may here mention a little kindly act, not less
indicative of a noble character. When he had
purchased Dummers Mead from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun’s
Monastery for the site of his College, a tailor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
claimed a part of it and took legal proceedings.
The man failed to establish his right, and was condemned
to pay the heavy costs, which would have
ruined him. Wykeham generously defrayed them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relics of Wykeham.</div>

<p>There are preserved in a curious vaulted strongroom
over the College sacristy, among other manuscripts,
a modest pedigree, tracing Henry <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>’s
descent from Adam, a Life of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas à
Becket deposited here by Wykeham,<a name="Anchor_52" id="Anchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a> and a roll
of the household expenses of the founder in 1394.<a name="Anchor_53" id="Anchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">[53]</a>
But if we wish to see his most interesting relics
we must go to New College, Oxford. Judging
from what remains there, we might almost conclude
that Wykeham was a giant in stature as well as
in mind.<a name="Anchor_54" id="Anchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a> There we find a pair of large crimson
silk gloves, with I. H. S. amid golden rays, worked
on their backs. His ring is about an inch wide,
of great solidity, with the crucifixion embossed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the gold at each side. The stone, about the size
of a sovereign, is in the shape of a heart and
colourless, probably rock crystal. This was doubtless
a thumb ring, but it is large even for that.
His mitre case is an extraordinary structure, made
of thick stamped leather, girded with iron bands
and locked at the top. It is a foot wide and
nearly two feet high, in shape resembling a beehive.
From the strength of the case we should
expect valuable contents. But no; the fragments
of the mitre show it to have been little superior
to a stage “property.” Its rods adorned with trefoil
leaves are of silver gilt, but the “jewels” are plentiful
and spurious. The tissue bearing the I. H. S. was
worked with seed pearls. The purfling which went
round the brow of the mitre was of brass, with
sham gems, alternated with small squares of silver
brightly enamelled with figures of men, animals, and
flowers.</p>

<p>The most costly of these “jocalia” is the central
piece of a morse or clasp for the cope. It is about
two inches wide, and is called a Mary crowned,
being in the form of an old-fashioned M, like a
horseshoe.<a name="Anchor_55" id="Anchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 55.">[55]</a> It is surrounded with pearls, emeralds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and garnets. In the centre stand two little figures
in gold, Mary and an angel, and between them is
a vase of garnet, from which springs a lily with
emerald leaves and flowers of pearls.</p>

<p>Behind a glass in New College Chapel is
Wykeham’s crozier; a magnificent work of silver
adorned with pinnacles and other ornaments, and
especially rich in scriptural figures in enamel.</p>

<p>At Oxford is, also, the only letter extant, written
by Wykeham&mdash;purchased at Sir Edward Dering’s
sale. It is in the clerkly hand, adopted by penmen
of the time, and the lines, now much faded, are
a foot long, but so few that the whole writing is
scarcely an inch wide. The letter, thus short and
long, was written from Shene,<a name="Anchor_56" id="Anchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 56.">[56]</a> to Lord Cobham,
in 1367, when he was on an embassy to the Pope,
of whose whereabouts Wykeham seems doubtful.
It is in French, and signed</p>

</div>

<p>Among these curiosities is the ivory horn of a
fish called a narwhal, which seems out of place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in the collection, unless it be considered emblematic
of the vocation of the first preachers of Christianity.
It probably belonged to Wykeham, and is
sixty-five inches long, the pointed end&mdash;supposed
to be an antidote for poison&mdash;having been cut off.
When Lord Leicester was Chancellor of Oxford in
1569, he asked the College to give him this horn.
They made a compromise, and by sending him this
prized extremity were allowed to keep the rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The College.</div>

<p>We enter the first court, and look with veneration
at the kneeling figure of Wykeham. Here was
impressed by a master-mind the prototype of our
public schools. The prelate chose the site outside
the walls of Winchester, in the Soke, which extended
round the south-east of the city, so that
the College might be entirely in the Bishop of
Winchester’s jurisdiction. As early as 1373, he
engaged a schoolmaster at Winchester, and three
years later had a warden and seventy scholars.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="image_chamber" id="image_chamber"><img src="images/chamber.jpg" alt="Chamber Court" /></a>
    <p class="caption">
       Chamber Court.
    </p>
</div>

<p>The buildings we see, with the exception of
the Chantry Chapel and schoolroom and tower, are
those erected by Wykeham. In March, 1393, the
warden, fellows, and scholars, took possession of
their new magnificent abode, marching in a triumphal
procession, headed by a cross-bearer, and chanting
songs of praise. Nevertheless, the accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
would not have seemed liberal in our days.
Three fellows had only one room; the seventy
scholars had six chambers, and those below fourteen
years slept two in a bed. These were in the
inner quadrangle. The outer quadrangle must then
have formed a somewhat unpoetical entrance to the
abode of the muses, although the warden and head-master
lived in it. In the front of it, built partly for
defence, were the brewery, bakehouse, and malt-rooms;
on the west side, the stables; and on the
east, the slaughter-houses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cloisters.</div>

<div class="figcenter gap_above">
    <a name="image_cloisters" id="image_cloisters"><img src="images/cloisters.jpg" alt="The Cloisters" /></a>
    <p class="caption">
       The Cloisters.
    </p>
</div>

<p>The Cloisters were built by Wykeham’s steward;
and I should like to have walked their “studious pale”
at my leisure, and to have spent some time in musing
over the past. These arches, this pavement, and this
clean roof of chestnut or Irish oak, have been present
to the mind and eye of many a learned man as he here
mused upon the great master works of the Greeks and
Romans. And after his ambition had been kindled,
and his breast inspired for a brief period, he had laid
him down to rest, and left nothing to inform us that
he ever lived, except a tablet on these silent walls.
I can conjure up the pensive figure of Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>,
who was often here, and attended the chapel services.
He presented the College with a chalice, cruets, and
tabernacle, all of gold, and gave the little boys some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
pocket-money, which, no doubt, was more valued by
them.<a name="Anchor_57" id="Anchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">[57]</a></p>

<p>Here are brasses to some of the fellows who died
in the sixteenth century. We see that John Watts
(Watto), reached the patriarchal age of a hundred
years. Some are commemorated in Latin verses&mdash;the
solemnity of death could not prevent a poetaster from
punning on the name of Lark, and one John Clerk,
who on earth “distilled rosy liquors,” is now “rejoicing
in living waters.” But we are also reminded
of younger and gayer scenes, of spirits full of hope
looking forward joyously to years of expected happiness.
The walls are scored with the names of these
aspirants, most of them afterwards unknown&mdash;for
studious boys rarely mark themselves upon wood and
stone&mdash;but we see here “Thos. Ken, 1646,” the celebrated
bishop, whose glorious hymns, “Awake, my
soul,” and “Glory to Thee, my God, this night,” first
appeared in a Manual of Prayers he composed for
Winchester College.</p>

<p>Alas! as I look through these arches to the grassy
enclosure, I see some small tombstones to the memory
of boys not destined even to feel the disappointments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of life. The rosebud has fallen upon the sod! The
thought is too melancholy, let us change to something
cheerful&mdash;and look at those young girls on the sward,
sketching the little old chapel which stands in the
centre with all its pristine beauty. It dates from
1430. There is a fine stained east window in it which
has old figures in the lower part. Over the chapel&mdash;intended
for private masses&mdash;is an apartment, now
used for a library. The whole is a little <i>bijou</i>.</p>

<p>The large schoolroom, built by Warden Nicholas
in 1687, is now used merely for concerts and other
entertainments. But the great grim signboard still
remains, warning the festive company that they must
learn, leave, or be whipped! This unpleasant notification
is impressed by a representation of a sword,
and something which looks alarmingly like a pitchfork,
but is really meant for a rod. In these days of
competitive examinations, it seems strange to be told
that the army is to be the last refuge for dunces.
This work of art is older than the building; its
scholastic designer remains among the great unknown.
Prominent here among other names, is that of Herbert
Stewart, painted with ink in letters of heroic size.<a name="Anchor_58" id="Anchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58.">[58]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>The height of the Hall gives it a magnificent
appearance, while the old oak in the panelling,
benches, tables, and roof, make it sombre and venerable.
Some old pieces of wood, about six inches
square, were shown us, which are still used by the
foundation boys for plates at breakfast and supper. In
early times the hall was warmed by a fire in the centre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Portraits.</div>

<p>Over the high table there is a full-length portrait of
William of Wykeham. It is on oak, but scarcely looks
as old as the days of Holbein. All we can hope is
that there was some likeness of Wykeham of which
it is a copy. There is also here a picture of Bishop
Morley with rosy cheeks, pointed beard, and a somewhat
cynical expression. He was in exile with
Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, and returned with him, and, to judge by
the carmine here freely used, had shared in his
master’s good living. Beneath this, by way of contrast,
I suppose, hangs the lantern face of Bishop
Fox&mdash;dark, close-shaven, ascetic&mdash;not altogether unlike
his patron Henry <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr> He was the man who
collected the bones out of the crypt, and placed them
in the chests.</p>

<p>On the wall of the passage to the kitchen there is
the picture of the “Trusty Servant,” almost as well
known as the College itself. The Latin verse dates
from 1560; the figure, from Queen Anne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“I remember that at first sight I thought it was
intended for the devil,” said Mr. Hertford, “and I am
not sure that the designer was not a plagiarist in this
respect. I have seen valentines like it.”</p>

<p>“But when we read the lines,” I replied, “we find
the intention is to represent virtues, not vices. The
cloven feet are to signify celerity, not bestiality; the
‘porker’s snout’ contentment, not greediness; and the
donkey’s head patience, not stupidity; the formidable
weapons and bundle of implements he carries are for
defensive and industrial purposes. This combination
of man and beast has a moral as well as a comic side,
and has much taken the public fancy.”</p>

<p>When we were opposite this picture, the porter
recited with some dramatic power the description of
this model domestic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line-1">“A trusty servant’s portrait would you see,</div>
    <div class="p_line">The emblematic figure well survey:</div>
    <div class="p_line">The porker’s snout&mdash;not nice in diet shows;</div>
    <div class="p_line">The padlock shut&mdash;no secrets he’ll disclose;</div>
    <div class="p_line">Patient the ass, his master’s wrath to bear,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Swiftness in errand&mdash;the stag’s feet declare;</div>

    <div class="p_line">The vest his neatness; open hand his faith;</div>
    <div class="p_line">Girt with his sword&mdash;his shield upon his arm,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Himself and master he’ll protect from harm.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We pitied the man who rehearsed these hackneyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
lines to every visitor, but hoped that to his ear they
had a musical, or perhaps, as Shakespeare says, a
silver sound.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brasses.</div>

<p>In the College Chapel we have the original roof,
and the brasses are exact reproductions of those
formerly existing here; which, though carefully
stored, were stolen when the pavement was undergoing
repair some twenty years ago. Fortunately a
boy with the suitable name of Freshfield had kept
rubbings of them, and by these they have been
restored. Warden Nicholas, though not a man of
puritanical views, removed the screen.</p>

</div>

<p>The College was visited by Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, and when
reverses came it was still safe, for Nicholas Love, the
regicide, son of a warden of that name, exerted himself
for its preservation, and Colonel Nathaniel
Fiennes, who was an old Wykehamist, when Cromwell
took possession of Winchester, placed a guard
at the gates of the College to prevent any depredations.</p>

<p>Poetic memories cluster richly around these old
walls. Ken has been mentioned, and Otway should
not be forgotten, but time ripened more abundant
fruit. There was Young, to whom so many wise
reflections came when&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and whose lines, “Procrastination is the thief of
time,” “At thirty man suspects himself a fool,” and
“All men think all men mortal but themselves,”
have become household words. Then there was
“Tom Warton,” of whom Johnson said that he was
the only man of genius he knew that had no heart.
In one sense the remark was perhaps true. Although
he was eminently sociable and genial, he
seems, from his writings, to have been free from
those amorous perplexities in which most poets are
involved. But he had a fine imagination, great
power of expression, and a considerable vein of
humour. Next came poor Collins, who died insane.
His father, a hatter, determined, like Sugden the
barber, to give his son the very best education.
Collins was a strange, fantastical fellow, though not
unworthy of the feather he wore in his cap. He
became a demi of Magdalen College, Oxford, and
wrote three odes&mdash;to Evening, to the Passions, and
on the Death of Thompson&mdash;never surpassed in the
English language. Truly the tree of knowledge was
here hung with golden fruit. Many other eminent
men have issued hence to adorn the Church and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
State, whose solid acquirements must not cause us
to undervalue the gifts of Sydney Smith, another
Wykehamist, who “could make not only the guests
and servants, but even the portraits laugh.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">School Fare.</div>

<p>Warton in his panegyric on ale, and in the affection
he practically showed for it, may have been influenced
by the remembrance of the joyous drinks of his
school life. He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line_i16">“Let the tender swain</div>
    <div class="p_line">Each morn regale with nerve-relaxing tea</div>
    <div class="p_line">Companion meet for languor-loving nymphs;”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and adds that he prefers a “material breakfast,”
consisting of a crust and tankard of ale. As
late as seventy years ago the boys continued
to have beer for breakfast, indeed that, and that
only, was allowed them liberally. Winchester seems
to have been long in forgetting the good old
Saxon times when each alderman consumed two
gallons of beer at a sitting. As for the boys’
dinner, what between fagging, and the seniors
having the first cut at the joint, the juniors often
had none&mdash;vegetables, never. When the square bits
of board were their only plates, they were certainly
not indulged with gravy. No wonder that they
heartily sang the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dulce Domum</span>” in the college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
meads when the time came for them to disperse for
their summer holidays.</p>

<p>Passing on down College Street, and admiring some
Virginian creepers, more bright than Henry <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>’s
stained glass, we soon came to the large gates of
Wolvesey Castle. There was a fortress here in Saxon
times, built, it is said, by Cynegils, and made over
by his son to the bishops of Winchester. There is a
mystery about the name. Some think it means Wolf’s
Island. Milner says the name came from Edgar
having required a Welsh prince to find 300 wolves’
heads and deposit them here every year. These
animals were then great pests, and when Alfred wrote
requesting the Archbishop of Rheims to permit <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Grimbald to come over, he sent him a present of wolf
hounds. The prelate acceding, says that the saint is
“not a dumb dog, but able to bark and drive away
evil spirits.”</p>

<p>The earlier castle which stood on this site had a
literary celebrity. Here Alfred’s scribes compiled the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, assisted by the King himself.
He ordered the precious volume to be kept at
Wolvesey&mdash;it is now in Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge. This was the first English prose book.</p>

<p>The structure of which we now see the ruins was
built by Bishop de Blois, brother of King Stephen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
out of the materials of the former castle, and of the
Saxon palace in the square. It was not long constructed
before it was used in a manner which showed
that the bishop’s weapons were not entirely spiritual.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burning of Winchester.</div>

<p>In 1141, during the civil wars, the southern part of
the city, including the Bishop’s palace and the Cathedral,
supported King Stephen, while the northern,
containing the best houses and Royal Castle, held
out for the Empress Matilda. A storm of fire-balls
poured forth from Wolvesey Castle, destroying the
Abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary, twenty churches, large private
buildings, the suburb of Hyde, and the splendid
monastery there situated. Fighting and firing raged in
the heart of the city for seven weeks! The Northern
party were at last driven into the Royal Castle, and
the water cut off. The Empress now adopted a
clever expedient; she kept out of sight, caused a
report to be circulated that she was dead, and had
preparations made for her funeral. Her body was
enclosed in lead like a corpse, and was thus allowed
to be carried out in a horse-litter through the
besiegers’ camp. Once safely in the open country
she soon was out of her coffin and into her saddle,
and, bestriding her good steed, galloped off towards
Devizes. Stephen, upon his obtaining the castle,
prepared it for vigorous defence, but before he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
ready heard an army was collecting against him and
took to flight. The monks of Hyde Abbey maintained
that during this conflict Bishop de Blois intentionally
fired from Wolvesey upon their monastery.</p>

<p>The war which devastated the country at this
time greatly interfered with agriculture, and a synod
was convened at Winchester, at which it was resolved,
“that plough and husbandman should have the same
privileges of sanctuary with churches,” and the whole
assembly, with torches in their hands, pronounced a
blazing excommunication against any one who injured
an agriculturist.</p>

<p>Wolvesey saw Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>&mdash;who had been crowned
at Winchester&mdash;in one of his worst moments. After
the murder of À Becket he found a great storm of
public feeling raised against him, and felt no longer
safe. On the 6th of August he passed through Winchester,
and visited this grim old Norman castle,
where Henry de Blois was dying, and here he heard
the bishop’s last words of bitter reproach, as he
foretold the great calamities which Divine vengeance
would pour upon the murderer of the Archbishop.
From this Henry hurried to Wales and to the subjugation
of Ireland. As late as Leland’s time this
was “a castelle, or palace well tow’red,” and it was
a residence till the Civil War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Raleigh.</div>

<p>Here, in Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>’s time, Bishop Fox, as a
blind and aged man, was interrogated about Prince
Arthur, who was born here, and gave very interesting
and lucid replies. Here Mary first saw Philip. Here
took place the famous trial of Raleigh before Popham
and others, during which the apartments of the
warden and fellows of the College were requisitioned
for the judges, sheriffs, and principal lawyers. The
fine old sailor kept a very cheerful countenance, we
are told, though so unwell and feeble that he was
accommodated with a seat. He was charged with
attempting to induce foreign enemies to invade the
King’s dominions; with attempting to restore the
Romish religion; and to place on the throne Arabella
Stuart, whom he was to meet in Jersey. The celebrated
Coke was the Crown counsel against him, and
indulged in virulent and coarse invectives, calling him
a terrible and detestable traitor.</p>

<p>“He hath a Spanish heart. You are an odious
man. See with what a &mdash;&mdash; forehead he defends his
faults. His treason tends not only to the destruction
of our souls, but to the loss of our goods, lands, and
lives. This is the man who would take away the
King and his cubs.”</p>

<p>Raleigh sometimes smiled during this tirade.
The last accusation was the only one which moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
him, and he said, referring to it, that Coke was a
base slave. “Humble, but not prostrate,” he answered
for himself; “showing love of life rather
than fear of death.” The charges against him were
on the authority of only one man, his former friend,
Lord Cobham. Raleigh quoted Scripture, that “in
the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every
word be established,” and demanded that Cobham
should be brought face to face with him. This was
refused. He said that in the Tower he got a poor
fellow to throw up an apple with a letter tied to it to
Cobham, who said, in reply, that he had wronged him.
But all was of no avail, and Popham condemned
Raleigh to be hanged till half dead, and then cut
down, quartered, and disembowelled. He left the
court without showing any signs of dismay. This
account is the more interesting and valuable, as it
comes from the pen of Sir Thomas Overbury, an
estimable man, poisoned by Carr, who afterwards
married his wife.</p>

<p>Raleigh, though he remained afterwards thirteen
years in the Tower, until his unfortunate and dishonest
expedition, was finally executed under this
sentence passed at Winchester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wolvesey.</div>

<p>All is now peaceful enough at Wolvesey. Time
has gnawed the walls, the Roundheads destroyed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
defences, and Bishop Morley peeled the whole to
erect the new palace which now stands beside these
sad remains. The string courses in the walls seem to
be a continuation of Roman architecture, and we
observe two good Norman windows and a couple of
imperfect arches; the outside of the keep can still be
recognized and the refectory. But nearly all the
interior is in a confused state of disintegration, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the man who can call the ruins picturesque must
have a happy imagination. Morley’s palace, now
used for school classes, is uninteresting; so is the
chapel, though, as a builder who had to repair the
roof assured me, the wood there, the east window
and south wall existed in the days of the castle.</p>

<p>Leaving Wolvesey, we continued by the line of the
city wall, and marked in places the insertion of
Roman tiles. There is little here to recall the conflicts
of men, but much, in the dark fruit-laden boughs,
to make us reflect on the generosity of nature and on
piping times, when every man can sit happily beneath
his own vine and fig-tree. And now we continue our
walk by the smooth river and by cottage gardens
bright with everlastings and “gipsy roses” (scabious),
till we find ourselves again on the site of the Eastgate
from which we started.</p>

<h2>FOURTH DAY.</h2>

<p class="summary">Jewry Street and the Jews &mdash; Hyde Abbey &mdash; <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Grimbald &mdash; Destruction
of Tombs &mdash; Headbourne Worthy &mdash; King’s
Worthy &mdash; The Nun’s Walk.</p>

<p>The west side of the George Hotel is in Jewry
Street, the <i>ghetto</i>, a name recalling the wealth,
rapacity, and persecutions of this peculiar people.
They managed to obtain property and to increase in
this city, apparently in the thirteenth century, previous
to which this street was called Scowertene Street. In
1232 a story was circulated that a boy had been
tortured and murdered by them.</p>

<p>“Invented, perhaps, by their debtors,” suggested
Mr. Hertford.</p>

<p>In Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>’s reign there was an order that the
Jews in Winchester should be taxed according to
their ability, as in London; but when the barons
sacked the town they are said to have extirpated
them. In 1268, however, one of them was made a
member of the Merchants’ Guild here, the only fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
as far as I know, that corroborates the statement of
Richard of Devizes, that “Winchester alone, the
people being prudent, spared its vermin.” We have
seen what became of “Aaron’s land,” and that of the
“son of Abraham” did not escape confiscation, for
we find that in Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>’s reign&mdash;“Thomas de Palmere
was granted a messuage in the great street of
Winchester, valued at four shillings a year. It had
belonged to Benedict, son of Abraham the Jew, and
had been forfeited to the King.”<a name="Anchor_59" id="Anchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">[59]</a> At a Parliament,
held here in 1290, the Jews were expelled from the
country.</p>

<p>Proceeding up the street, we pass on the right-hand
side the old stable in which “Master Say” was
tortured in the time of the Civil War. A little farther
on, if we look up over the shops on the other side, we
shall plainly trace the outlines of a large building.
This was once the city gaol, built by James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, rebuilt
in 1771, and the central portion of it, where there is
now an ironmonger’s shop, was the governor’s house
about twenty years since, and boasted a haunted
chamber, in which one of the debtors committed
suicide. It was afterwards used for the Museum
until the Guildhall was built in 1873, and the gaol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and bridewell were removed to the Romsey Road.
Farther on stands the Corn Exchange and Cattle
Market.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hyde Street.</div>

<p>Crossing the City Road we went straight on into
Hyde Street, which seems like a continuation of
Jewry Street. On the right Fossedyke House
commemorates the city walls and ditch. Farther on
I noticed a relic of the past&mdash;a small shop with a
gable, very low rooms, and windows scarcely more
than a foot high. Two steps descended into it, a proof
of age&mdash;as either the soil outside has risen, or the
owner has been, like the Irishman, “raising his roof.”
On the other side, we came to the large malthouse
of Mr. Dear, with walls of cut stone, formerly a barn
belonging to Hyde Abbey.</p>

<p>Opposite, we see through a side street the
“Soldiers’ Home.” This was about fifty years ago
the celebrated school of Mr. Richards, at which were
Deans Garnier and Gaisford, Lord Liverpool, George
Canning, Wolfe the poet, and perhaps Disraeli who
was at a boarding school in Winchester. It was afterwards
the Museum, and is now used for Salvation
meetings. The Army has been “bombarding” Winchester
for some time, and now marches through the
streets with Salvation guernseys, hallelujah bonnets,
and scarves white, red, and blue, to the music of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
drums, trumpets, and cymbals. All this noise and
dramatic show is attractive: whether it makes people
religious I cannot say, but it promotes the cause of
teetotalism. I went one day from curiosity to a “free
and easy” at the Corn Exchange, and observed that
the congregation were mostly men. Their attention
was kept by the variations in the service, by “knee-drill,”
singing on the knees, clapping the hands, and
singing with the eyes shut. The preacher, an
eloquent man, said they wanted money to build a
barrack in Parchment Street, which was to be somewhat
larger than the Cathedral! (a titter.) He added
that some considered that the Salvationists could do
nothing right, nothing properly. They even thought
they could not make a collection properly, and he
was almost inclined to agree with them, when he saw
the miserable contributions there were last Sunday.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hyde Abbey.</div>

<p>A Roman urn was found in this street; and in
turning to the right, down Alfred Place I noticed
a corner-stone of a “Druidical” character. In a few
yards, we came to the little church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew,
with a Norman entrance arch, rich in zig-zag&mdash;one-third
restored. Here is a stoup, and the lancet
windows in the nave are in their original positions.
Close beside the churchyard is a building with an
arch, apparently the entrance to the monastery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
On either side of the arch is a head, much decayed,
but the drawn-back hair can be traced, and the
crowns of Alfred and his son Edward, it is supposed.
These carvings seem older than the arch, which is
only Tudor. In the massive wall of an adjoining
garden a low window was pointed out to me, now
half hidden in the soil; and until lately there was an
arch visible beside it, which is now walled up. Passing
through the gate into the farmyard I came to the
stream which rises at Headbourne Worthy, and here
runs under a very primitive arch, which has some of
the old monastery wall still remaining on it. The
rivulet flows round the black fence of the Steam
Laundry into a street, called from it, Upper Brooks.</p>

<p>I found that the road past the monastery ended
immediately, and learned that the reason of this was
that for a short time the Bridewell, for which the
ruins of Hyde Abbey were despoiled, stood till late
years at the termination.</p>

<p>This information I obtained from a mechanic
whom we met with. I was desirous of obtaining local
information, and asked him if there were more ruins
here.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I think there’s some of the old tackle
up there,” he replied, pointing in the direction of the
barn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you belong to this place?” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he replied; “and for forty years I
belonged to the devil.”</p>

<p>I stared at him, for he was a most respectable-looking
man.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I did,” he continued. “But what a
difference it makes to a man when he has his eyes
opened! I never used to pray. I used to eat and
drink and work, and go once a week to the organ-loft
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s there, and have a sing, and
thought that was all that was necessary. How differently
I feel now!”</p>

<p>“Much better, no doubt,” I returned. “Have any
ancient remains been discovered here?”</p>

<p>“Something less than twenty years ago a man was
digging about the site of this bridewell wherever they
would let him. He was a long time at it, but he had
read books, and knew exactly where to go. He was
a strange sort of man, fond of bones and coffins,
which he found and put into the church.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Alfred.</div>

<p>Hyde Abbey, called the New Minster, previous to
Norman times went on its travels like the other
Winchester institutions. It was founded by Alfred
close to the northern side of the Cathedral. He
bought ground for the chapel and dormitory, and
perhaps built them, but left the main work to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
completed by his son. It was called the Monastery
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Grimbald. When Alfred went to Rome with
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun, he stopped for some days on his way
at the convent of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bertin, in France, and there sat,
a lovely and studious child, at the feet of Grimbald.
He not only profited by the religious teaching, but
conceived a great affection for this gracious president,
and sent for him to superintend his new foundation.
Grimbald came in 885, and the King and Archbishop
Ethred received him “as an angel.” A meeting was
called, and Grimbald made an effective speech,
strongly condemning the sins of unchastity, covetousness,
lying, murder, and theft. He also spoke of
pride and gluttony, “through which our first parent
was driven from his flowery abode.” Alfred followed
with a speech commending study to his nobility,
who were very illiterate at the time.</p>

<p>Learning was then at a low ebb in England owing
to the ravages of the Danes, and in Winchester the
churches had been despoiled, the priests murdered, the
nuns outraged, and Christianity nearly abolished.
Alfred resolved to reinstate it, and Grimbald was
to teach the children of the thanes as well as to
give advice about the proposed monastery.</p>

<p>Alfred died fifteen years after Grimbald’s arrival
in England, and the Annals tell us he was buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
“becomingly, and with kingly honour in the royal
city of Winchester, in the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s.
His tomb is still extant, made of the most precious
porphyry marble.” Although unwilling to say a
word against the good monks of Hyde, I fear
that it must be admitted they were now guilty
of a little trickery. The canons of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun
“foolishly thought they saw the disembodied spirit
of King Alfred moving about their habitation,” and
I am afraid we must conclude that some of the
monks of Hyde, to obtain the valuable body of
the King, dressed themselves up as the ghost and
frightened the poor canons. Thus the corpse was
transferred to the New Minster.<a name="Anchor_60" id="Anchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 60.">[60]</a></p>

<p>The monastery soon obtained another melancholy
acquisition. The building was finished in 903, and,
Ponthieu in Picardy having been ravaged, the inhabitants
fled, and nobles and religious people came
swarming like bees to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Grimbald, and brought
with them the bones of the sacred confessor <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Josse&mdash;a British prince. Grimbald received this
consignment with great honour, with a brilliant
retinue of clergy, and an immense concourse of the
faithful. Miracles soon appeared, and the dry bones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
brought life and livelihood into the monastery. At
the dedication of the basilica to the Sacred Trinity,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, there was a brilliant
assembly, and farms were bestowed by the King
and nobles. Queen Emma afterwards gave the head
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Valentine.</p>

<p>Grimbald, “a good singer and most learned in
holy Scripture,” had a conflict with the old scholars
at Oxford, and was not well pleased at the impartial
manner in which Alfred decided it. As he became
old he withdrew himself, and lived privately in this
Abbey at Winchester, intent only upon psalms and
hymns, and unwilling to speak of anything secular.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sword and Gown.</div>

<p>The New Monastery fared badly after the battle
of Hastings. The Abbot at this time was unfortunately
an uncle of Harold. When he heard of
the Norman invasion he persuaded twelve stalwart
brethren to take the Saxon helmet, and, raising
twenty additional men, marched to Hastings with
his little company. They took the sword in place
of the crucifix, and used it with such effect that
they became conspicuous in the conflict. The Abbot
fell close to Harold. Perhaps their costume attracted
attention, they may have had gown and sword, but at
any rate William’s attention was attracted to them,
and he determined to take vengeance on an establishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
whose members gave him so much trouble.
He confiscated some fifteen manors belonging to
them&mdash;about 17,000 acres of land, and he built his
palace in such a position as greatly to inconvenience
them, shutting up the communication by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Lawrence’s into the High Street.</p>

<p>It now became clearly recognized that the New
Monastery was too much confined, it was so close to
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun’s that the ringing and singing were “like
sweet bells jangled.” The monks resolved to move
outside the city to Hyde Mead, though the ground
in that locality was so springy that they had to
bring a quantity of clay, and to cover it, in some
places, four feet deep. The old site was given to
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun’s, which in return gave some land and
some additional days at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’ fair. In 1110
the fraternity moved in solemn procession, with all
their worldly goods, consisting mainly of the cross
of Cnut, body of Alfred, and some other old bones,
into what promised to be a peaceful abode.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treasures of Hyde.</div>

<p>But thirty years afterwards, on the occasion of
the conflict between Stephen and Matilda, the
establishment was destroyed, as I have already
said, by Bishop de Blois sending fire balls at it
out of Wolvesey. From the representations now
made to the Pope we learn how magnificently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
adorned the church was, and how successful had
been the miracles there wrought. The flames melted
the gold and silver, and the bishop compelled the
monks to give him the precious ashes, especially
those of the great cross, given by Cnut, which contained
sixty pounds of silver, and fifteen of gold, that
king’s revenue for a year.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

       CNUT AND EMMA (ÆLFGYFU) PLACING THE CROSS AT HYDE.<br />
       (<i>From an Anglo-Saxon MS.</i>)
    </p>
</div>

<p>There were three diadems of gold and precious
stones worth <abbr title="118 pounds">£118</abbr>, two images adorned with gold
and gems, worth <abbr title="49 pounds">£49</abbr>. Of silver there were many
other valuables, the seal of the house, two patens,
a vase for holy water, and two lavers, nobly adorned
with gold and gems, said to be of Solomonic work,
perhaps in imitation of those in the Jewish temple,
and worth <abbr title="35 pounds">£35</abbr>. De Blois had endowed his hospital
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cross out of the spoil, and the whole amount of
damages claimed was not less than <abbr title="4862 pounds">£4,862</abbr>, which
might be multiplied by twenty to form a right
estimate of it at present.</p>

<p>In consequence of the complaints sent to the
Pope, the warlike bishop had to make some restitution.
But it was not till twenty-six years afterwards
(1167) that a goldsmith’s copy of the cross<a name="Anchor_61" id="Anchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61.">[61]</a> was
executed and presented to the Convent. The restoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of the buildings was gradual, and in 1312
part was still in ruins.</p>

<p>Hyde Abbey, though planned by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Grimbald
with such excellent intentions, was not free from the
weakness inherent in all human institutions. There
was from 1182 such a flow of miracles from the altar
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Barnabas there that the monastery was sometimes
spoken of as if dedicated to that saint. Crowds
of poor, sick, and infirm people congregated there,
and as the place declined in morality it grew in
celebrity, so that in 1390 William of Wykeham
authorized the abbot to use a mitre, ring and
pastoral staff.</p>

<p>In 1507 the vices attendant on wealth and luxury
became so conspicuous as to require rebuke. The
good monks were making free use of the taverns, and
were bringing into the monastery women who were
not of a saintly character. The last abbot of Hyde,
John Salcot, was “a great cleark, and singularly
learned in divinity.” He became Bishop of Bangor,
and then of Salisbury, and his principles were of
the willow pattern. At Windsor he tried three
reformers, and condemned them to be burnt, and
burnt they were; but under Edward <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> he himself
became a reformer, and gave the Duke of Somerset
several church manors. In Mary’s reign he averred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
that his compliance with Edward’s wishes had been
caused by threats and from fear of his life, and
sentenced Hooper and Rogers and three others to
the stake, where they were burned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spoliation.</div>

<p>Wriothesley writes in 1538, being the chief acting
commissioner here: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">About three o’clock a.m., we
made an end of the shrine of Winchester. We think
the silver will amount to near two thousand marks.
Going to bedsward we viewed the altar. Such a piece
of work it is that we think we shall not rid of it before
Monday or Tuesday morning. Which done we
intend both at Hyde and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s to sweep
away all the rotten bones, called relics, which we
may not omit lest it should be thought we came
more for the treasure than for avoiding the abominations
of idolatry.</span>” Wriothesley was granted several
of the richest manors of Hyde, and having a lease
of the site, pulled down the abbey and sold the
materials. He made over the site to the Bethell
family. The lands he left to his children, but a
failure of male descent, which no doubt the Roman
Catholics regarded as a judgment, caused the abbey
manors to be distributed to many families. Some
of them went to Lady Rachel Russell, a daughter of
Thomas, Earl of Southampton. She lived much at
Stratton, where her letters were written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1788 the magistrates of Hampshire bought
the site of the abbey to erect a bridewell. Dr.
Milner writes: “At almost every stroke of the
mattock or spade some ancient sepulchre or other
was violated, the venerable contents of which were
treated with marked indignity.” A crozier, patens,
chalices, and rings, and “fantastic capitals” were now
found, stone coffins were broken and bones scattered.
Three superior coffins were found in front of the altar,
and a slab, probably the base of a statue of Alfred,
which is now at Corby Castle, in Cumberland. It
is impossible to determine what relics were then
destroyed.</p>

<p>The bones found in 1867 lie under a stone
marked simply with a cross, beneath the east
window of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s Church. They belonged
to five persons, supposed to be Alfred, his
queen and two sons, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Grimbald. The four
first mentioned were found in a chalk vault, at the
east end of the church of Hyde Monastery. The
bones of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Grimbald were in another chalk vault,
under the chancel, near the north transept, which
extended where there is now a timber yard, on
the east side of the present church. In Milner’s
time, the ruins of the church nearly covered a
meadow. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s was probably like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
church at Battle, built for the tenants and servants
of the abbey. The cut stones, with which its walls
are studded, give it a chequered or chessboard
appearance, and suggest the spoliation of some
earlier building. But a portion at least, of the
church existed long before the destruction of the
abbey. The alternation of squares of stone and
flintwork is an example of what was in times past
a favourite device, now known by architects as
“diaper work.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Walk to Headbourne.</div>

<p>Returning into Hyde Street, my friends went
home; and I, walking on towards the country, came
to some pretty outskirts of Winchester. Here are
bright villas, covered with flowering rose-trees, and a
thatched cottage swathed in ivy. The road gradually
becomes overshadowed on both sides by beeches
and elms, which soon give place on the left to
corn-fields, dotted over with children “gleazing,”
while on the right appears the long wall and
fine plantations of Abbots Barton&mdash;an old monastic
farm.</p>

<p>Just before coming to Headbourne Worthy, I
passed two semi-detached cottages of red brick,
with ornamental windows. These cheerful dwellings
stand on a site of dark memory. Two years ago,
a hayrick was here, under which a couple of young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
sailors, tramping along the road, took refuge at
night from a storm. Though in this uncomfortable
position, they managed to quarrel about money&mdash;with
which neither was well provided&mdash;and at last
the discussion grew so hot that the elder&mdash;twenty-seven
years of age&mdash;pursued the younger, a boy
of eighteen round the rick, with an open knife in
his hand. The latter cried aloud, but the wind
and rain prevented his being heard, except by a
dog at a neighbouring cottage, who raised his voice
in vain. At last the deed was done, and the murderer
took three shillings from the body, which he covered
up with hay. He then made off, but was captured
and executed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Winchester Scholar.</div>

<p>I now descend a hill between high grassy banks,
and reach Headbourne Worthy&mdash;the stately designation
only signifying a village. The church has
a somewhat modern appearance outside, but, according
to some, has Saxon portions. At the west end,
we find a small Norman arch leading into the vestry,
where there is a bas-relief, almost obliterated, of the
Crucifixion and two Marys, larger than life. It
is supposed that these figures were originally on
the outer wall of the church, and that the room
in which they now are, in which an upper floor
and piscina are traceable, was a chapel built round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
them. There is in the church a handsome piscina
and some sedilia. But the chief pride of the little
sanctuary is a brass, said to be in a certain sense
unique. It dates from 1434, and is in memory
of a boy who died when one of the scholars at
“New College” in Winchester. He stands here, with
closely-cut hair and a gown fastened down the front,
giving a good idea of the appearance of the scholars
of that day. A scroll proceeds out of his mouth,
with the words, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Misericordiam Dm̄ inetm̄ cantabo</span>,”
which is supposed to mean that he will sing the
school chants eternally.</p>

<p>I returned the keys to a small house, a few
yards off, in the garden of which I observed some
of the finest “everlastings” I had seen in this country.
Beside it ran a grass-carpeted lane, down which a
pedestrian wishing to return to Winchester in a
mile, and able to face an easy fence, might turn
to the right across a field and walk beside a bank
gay with knopweed, fleabane, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s wort,
until he reached the Nuns’ Walk. I, however, continued
up the hill, and, passing a red-brick house,
with four splendid lignums in front of it, came to
King’s Worthy&mdash;once Crown property as the name
denotes.</p>

<p>There is nothing remarkable about the church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
except a Norman arch at the west entrance. The
tombstones outside are sadly gay with wreaths
and floral crosses. Short-lived they are, for the
fences not being perfect cows stray in, and, unable
to read of the virtues of the deceased, munch up
and trample on the offerings in a most unsentimental
manner. The body of the boy Parker, of whose
murder I have spoken, having been refused, as I
was told, burial at Headbourne, was interred here
on the south-west side, and a headstone raised to
his memory by subscription.</p>

<p>Crossing the graveyard to return home, I found
myself in a field, where stand two elms of immense
height and girth. Then&mdash;in and out&mdash;under old
ivy-mantled trees&mdash;over a stile, and under the railway
arch, I come into a large oozy field, which eyebright
loves, and where sleek cattle are grazing; then I
reach the clear Itchen, dozing and gleaming in the
sun. Here I am beside the river of Isaak Walton.
I fancy that I can see on the bank opposite, the
quaint figure of the piscatorial draper, who was
always ready to exchange his yard stick for his
fishing-rod, and whose writing flows along as clearly
and smoothly as the stream he gazed on. Those
who wish to know something of his bodily presence
may look at his statue by Miss Grant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Brooks.</div>

<p>Awaking from my reverie, I cross by a plank
bridge the rivulet which passes Headbourne Church
and rises just above it. This stream, which accompanies
the Nuns’ Walk, is said by some old writers
to have been conducted into Winchester by Æthelwold.
It was evidently turned artificially, perhaps
by that eminent man; whoever directed it seems
to have raised the Nuns’ Walk to bank up the
stream.</p>

<p>Another rivulet running close beside it, drawn
from the Itchen and used for irrigation, is called the
Mill Stream, from an old mill which stood near:
both flow in old water courses, as the willows along
them testify. I crossed over to the last mentioned,
which was set with the spears of bulrushes and
gemmed with blue forget-me-nots, and walked on
beside it upon fronds of silver weed, gathering
watercresses at times, which seemed refreshing under
the hot sun, till I crossed back into the Nuns’
Walk. It is difficult to understand why this name
was given to the path, perhaps from its beauty;
for it was far from the nunnery, though close to
Hyde Monastery. If the nuns frequented it, they
must have met the monks here. Let us hope on
these trying occasions they kept their eyes rivetted
on their books, or “commercing with the skies.” In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the earlier period, however, the brethren were canons
and mostly married. Would that we could picture
here the stately figure of Bishop Æthelwold, whom
their worldliness so deeply grieved!</p>

<p>Continuing along the walk by the clear stream,
and occasionally startling a trout, which shot under
the shade of the bank, I passed Abbots Barton
farm, with its mullioned windows and old sun-dial.
Farther on, I came to three little boys, fishing
with landing nets&mdash;would that Gainsborough could
have seen that group! I asked them whether they
were successful; to which they replied&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we have caught several minnows, and
some dog-fish.”</p>

<p>“Dog-fish? What may they be?”</p>

<p>“Some call them trotters,” they returned, and
showed me the can in which their take had been
deposited; but although I looked attentively, I
could see nothing. They assured me, however, that
they were there safe enough, and I was glad they
enjoyed the sport, though I could not say much
for the fry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Monster Trout.</div>

<p>Trudging on in the chequered light which the
sunshine cast through the glossy leaves of witch
elms, I came to a man feeding ducks. It was one
o’clock, and he was eating his dinner of bread and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
cucumber, with a clasp knife. Every minute he
was throwing in pieces of bread, and watching
their scrambles. I stopped as I was passing. He
looked at me with a smile, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I think they are getting nearly as much as I am.”</p>

<p>“You seem very liberal to them,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Yes; but they ought not to be here. This
is a nursery, and they eat the small fish.”</p>

<p>“Are there any large fish in the stream?” I
inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, very often; but I take them out and
put them into the river. The Itchen is the place
for the large fish.”</p>

<p>“What sized fish have you there?”</p>

<p>“I have seen trout there of six or eight pounds,
but one was caught a few weeks ago that weighed
sixteen pounds; and you can see it now, stuffed,
at Mr. Chalkley’s, near the Butter Cross.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<p>“He must have been an old fellow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very. I should say, twenty years. I had
known him in the upper water for three years; but
one time, when the hatch was open, he got into
the lower water and was then, in fact, in the town.
Plenty of people went out to try to catch him,
but he escaped them for eighteen months; but at
last was taken off his guard.”</p>

<p>“Have you any other fish here?”</p>

<p>“There are a few perch in the river, but we
don’t want them; there ought to be none at all
in it. Lower down, at Twyford, there are some
grayling; and at Bishopstoke, some salmon-ladders
have been placed to lead them up here, but they
will not come.”</p>

<p>The capture of the large trout to which he
alluded had made quite a sensation in Winchester.
Not only was it stuffed and exhibited, but its
portrait was taken. It seems remarkable that
though the fish had been hooked so often, there
were no barbs found in its mouth&mdash;this is generally
the case, they come out by some kindly
provision of nature. I need scarcely say that this
veteran, when cooked, was not found particularly
tender.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brooks.</div>

<p>To the east of the walk on which I stood,
a rich pasture land extended, looking very tempting
for a stroll. It is divided into two farms&mdash;one
entered under the Hyde arch; the other by the
Mill, at the farther end of the town. The ground is
intersected with dykes and rivulets, and especially by
one large clear stream, which enjoys the unsuitable
name of the Black Ditch. This feeds the “middle
and lower brooks,” being led along the streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
so called. The “upper brook” street is supplied by
the stream which has travelled beside us from
Headbourne, and, being spring water, is thought
better than the rest. My impression is that the
work of Æthelwold consisted in making the small
canals or “brooks,” which flow into the town from
a few yards behind the City Road, and perhaps
some cutting across the meadow, and that the
Headbourne stream was banked up at a later period,
after the building of Hyde Monastery, through which
it took a remarkably convenient course.</p>

<p>The southern part of this pasture land was
the scene of the famous combat between Guy and
Colbrand. Passing by some cottages covered with
ivy, and some gardens flaming with phlox, I found
myself back at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s Church.</p>

<h2>FIFTH DAY.</h2>

<p class="summary">The Cathedral &mdash; Early History &mdash; Dagon &mdash; <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun &mdash; Æthelwold &mdash; The
Vocal Cross &mdash; Ordeal of Fire &mdash; Walkelin &mdash; Renovation
of the Cathedral &mdash; Civil War &mdash; Architecture &mdash; Nave &mdash; Isaak
Walton &mdash; Relics and Monuments &mdash; De la
Roche &mdash; Frescoes &mdash; Ethelmar &mdash; Crypt.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago I visited Winchester, and attended
service in the Cathedral. A verger, with the usual
courtesy of his kind, showed me into one of the
“misery” stalls, and I found myself very happy therein.
The music was delightful. The boys’ voices
seemed to waft me up to heaven, and the bass sent
me down below the earth. The latter performance
by one of commanding stature, who possessed something
worthy of being called an “organ,” greatly
impressed me. As I was passing out I observed to
the verger, “That bass man is very grand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir,” he replied;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> “if you were to hear him
hollow out, ‘Judge me,’ you would say it was the
finest thing in the world.”</p>

<p>“That is a somewhat modern experience,” observed
Mr. Hertford. “Let us hear something about the
early history of the Cathedral.”</p>

<p>“As early as you please,” I replied. “Warton tells
us that ‘many reputable historians report that this
city was founded by Ludor Rous Hudibras 892 years
before Christ.’”</p>

<p>“The name Hudibras,” returned Mr. Hertford,
“suggests that they belonged to the comic school.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Britons.</div>

<p>“Or poetic,” I continued, “Warton was poet-laureate,
and his brother was head-master here. But
there is no doubt that the site on which this Cathedral
stands was of prehistoric sanctity. Hard by at the
southern gate of the Close we find in the road two
Druidical monoliths. Was not this a place where the
long-haired, skin-clad Britons came to lay their offerings?
Did not some mighty chieftain repose here
beneath a rude dolmen? Below the crypt there is a
well which reminds us of the holy wells&mdash;such as that
of Madron in Cornwall&mdash;changed by the early Church
from pagan to Christian veneration.</p>

<p>“A wave of the wand of the great magician, Time,
brings us to Roman days. On the south and west
are red-roofed villas, with spreading courts. Close to
us, on the east, stand the old temple of Concord, and
the new one to Apollo&mdash;low buildings, but large, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
girdled by pillars, with acanthus-leaved capitals, such
as those we see to-day lying on the grass at Silchester.
Here pass the stately processions of white-robed
“flamens,” who here placed their principal British
college. But side by side with these time-honoured
and worn-out institutions grew up the Christian
Church. King Lucius on his conversion gave to it
the possessions of these old priests, extending 2,000
paces on every side of the city. He built a little
house, with an oratory, dormitory, and refectory, and
placed in it monks of the order of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mark the
Evangelist. But his greatest work here was the construction
of the Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Amphibalus, two
hundred and nine paces long, eighty wide and ninety
high.<a name="Anchor_62" id="Anchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 62.">[62]</a>”</p>

<p>“Paces?” interrupted Mr. Hertford, “what a stupendous
structure! and very ‘airy’ I should think.
Are you sure that it was not built for the marines?”</p>

<p>“Large as it was,” I continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> “Lucius’s voice would
have filled it. We are told that when he became
Bishop of Coire, in Switzerland, he chose a rock for
his pulpit&mdash;his finger-marks remain there to prove it&mdash;and
held forth so vehemently that he was heard
twelve miles off&mdash;about as far as thunder would be
audible.”</p>

<p>“You have evidently been among some of those
jesting monks,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; what I have narrated about Winchester
is from no goliard, but from Rudborne, a Benedictine
of the place; a ‘sad’ fellow truly, but in the
older and better sense.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Saxons.</div>

<p>After a great destruction of monks and buildings
during the Diocletian persecution, the brethren
rebuilt and re-entered their church&mdash;of which Constans,
son of Constantine, and afterwards Emperor, was
then high-priest&mdash;and had peace for two hundred and
ten years. Then came, in 500, the terrible Cerdic,
against whom King Arthur fought so valiantly. He
defeated the natives in a great battle where is now
the New Forest, and entered the city. The monks
were slaughtered, and an image of Dagon set up in
the Christian church. We can scarcely picture the
barbaric scenes when this prince of the Saxons was
crowned, and buried, in this heathen temple.</p>

<p>Why does Rudborne call this the temple of the
Philistine god Dagon? Perhaps it was merely a
term of contempt, to signify an outlandish deity.
But we know that Dagon had a fish’s tail, and might
it be that the Saxons arriving by sea, invested their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
figure of Woden here with some of the merman’s
attributes? It is a curious coincidence&mdash;nothing
more&mdash;that the Roman pavement in the Museum,
found in Minster Lane, about a hundred yards from
the west entrance of the Cathedral, is ornamented
with representations of dolphins.<a name="Anchor_63" id="Anchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">[63]</a></p>

<p>“I am glad we have come to the Saxons,” said Mr.
Hertford, “there is something interesting about them.
They lived in a fitful light. The sun of civilization
was struggling through the clouds of primitive darkness.
Literature was springing into life, with that
centralization which begets great achievements.”</p>

<p>“A hundred and forty-two years after Cerdic we
reach the light,” I continued. “Cynegils destroyed
this heathen temple and began to refound Winchester
Church, which his successor, Cenwalh,
finished about the middle of the seventh century.
He dedicated it to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Birinus, who had been sent
over by Pope Honorius. Hedda translated the
bishopric of the West Saxons from Dorchester to
Winchester, and brought hither the bones of Birinus,
by means of which the neighbourhood soon began to
be blessed or cursed with miracles.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun.</div>

<p>We now reach the days of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun, who in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
lifetime came down upon the Church in showers not
of water, but of gold. He induced Athelwolf, Alfred’s
father, to give tithes of the Crown lands, and the grant
was confirmed here by the King, in a grand ceremony
before the high altar of “<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s.” Swithun
(a native of the place) was first Prior and then
Bishop of Winchester, and well deserved remembrance.
He moulded the mind of Alfred, and
persuaded Ethelbald to put away his mother-in-law,
whom, by some eccentricity, he had married.
From feelings of humility, or fearing that his body
would be utilized after his death, Swithun ordered
that he should be buried outside the church on
the west; where, writes Rudborne, “a little chapel
can be seen on the north of the Cathedral.” (This
chapel, which has disappeared, was probably not built
until many years after the interment.)</p>

<p>Æthelwold was a pillar of the Church. He repaired
the nunnery founded here by Alfred’s queen,
and purchased the sites of Ely, Peterborough, and
the “Thorney” isle, on which the “Minster of the
West” stands. He rebuilt the Cathedral of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Swithun&mdash;upon plans apparently of that saint&mdash;assisting
in the good work not only as an architect,
but also as a manual labourer. Great opposition was
made to him by the “adversary,” but he was supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
by power from above. One day a great post fell
upon him breaking nearly all the ribs on one side of
his body, and but for his falling into a pit he would
have been crushed altogether. Another day one of the
monks who were working on the highest part of the
church fell from the top to the bottom, but as soon as
he touched the earth and made the sign of the cross,
he ascended in the sight of all up to the place where
he had stood, took up his trowel, and continued his
work as if nothing had happened!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Saxon Cathedral.</div>

<p>The church thus miraculously raised is represented
by Wolstan, who saw it, as a wondrous edifice. It
was built with “Dædalion” ingenuity. There were
so many buildings with altars round the nave that
the visitor would become confused, and not be able
to find his way about. A tower was added, detached,
and so lofty that its golden beaks (gargoyles)
caught the rays of the rising sun and, with a little
stretch of imagination, “made perpetual day.” The
crypts were like the church, so large and intricate,
that “a man in them could not find his way out and
did not know where he was.” The latter statement
was true in one sense, as the occupants were mostly
kings and bishops, who were brought in to be buried.</p>

<p>Wolstan is grand upon the organ; indeed, he
works it a little too hard. He says that it sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
sounded like thunder, and was heard all over the city.
Whatever its modulations may have been, it must
have been powerful, for there were twelve pairs of
bellows, worked by “the arms of seventy men with
great labour and perspiration.” This instrument had
forty “musæ,” notes, I suppose, and was played by two
of the brethren.</p>

<p>The tower was surmounted by a rod with golden
balls, which shone in the moonbeams as if they were
“stars upon earth.” On the top of all was a splendid
weather-cock. It was fitting that such a building
should be presided over by a brave bird.</p>

<p>“The Winchester monk himself seems to have
crowed pretty loudly over it,” observed Mr. Hertford.</p>

<p>Æthelwold had the body of Birinus, which Hedda
had buried simply and respectably, taken up and
wrapped in sheets of silver and gold. He was also
conveniently admonished by a dream to move the
body of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun, and a curious Saxon account of
this direction is extant.<a name="Anchor_64" id="Anchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64.">[64]</a> The saint, in shining light
and full canonicals, appeared to an old smith, and
told him to send to Æthelwold to remove his bones.</p>

<p>“Oh! sire,” replied the smith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> “he will not believe
my word.”</p>

<p>“Then,” quoth the saint, “let him go to my burial-place
and draw up a ring out of the coffin, and if the
ring yields at the first tug then wot he of a truth that
I sent thee to him.”</p>

<p>The smith was still afraid, but when the saint had
appeared three times to him he went to the tomb and
took hold of the ring, which came out of the stone at
once. But it was some years after this, before the
cures wrought led to Æthelwold’s translating the
body. The bishop took it out of the “poor tomb,”
where it had rested for 110 years, and had it placed
in a sheet of gold. He made this translation the
occasion for a great demonstration, by which a vast
crowd of people was collected; and the relics which
had produced nothing in the days of the secular
canons, now, under the care of the monks became
the source of countless miracles&mdash;not much to the
credit of the latter custodians. Within the ten days
succeeding its removal, two hundred persons were
healed, and afterwards sometimes eighteen a day.
The graveyard was so covered with the diseased lying
about that it was almost impossible to reach the
church.</p>

<p>“I should not have attempted it,” interposed Mr.
Hertford.</p>

<p>“Well; it would have been worth seeing,” I replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
“for it was hung round from one end to the other
with crutches and cripples’ stools, and even so they
could not put half of them up.”</p>

<p>“It is difficult to suppose,” said Mr. Hertford,
thoughtfully, “that all the money that was given
for pretended miracles was paid for nothing. Persons
whose constitutions or disorders were of a
nervous character probably received some benefit.
Their spirits would be raised by their anticipations
and the brilliance of the scene. Some recovered from
natural causes, and those who grew worse soon died,
or were not inclined to be profane in their sufferings.
You remember the remark of Diogenes?”</p>

<p>“I have read some things he said,” I returned,
“and some attributed to him which he did not
say.”</p>

<p>“He was visiting a temple,” continued Mr. Hertford,
“and was shown the offerings made by those
who had been cured. ‘Yes,’ he replied to the priest;
‘but if those who had not been cured had offered
gifts, they would have been far more numerous.’”</p>

<p>It is said that the transference of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun’s
body, which had lain between the old wooden tower
and the church, was delayed by forty days’ rain&mdash;and
hence the proverb. The postponement may seem
strange, as the tomb was but a few feet from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
church; but it was a main object to have a great
concourse of people.</p>

<p>And let me here notice a coincidence. We know
that in the early centuries sun worship was much
intermingled with Christianity; we have traces of it
in our “Sunday,” in the orientation of churches, and
several observances.</p>

<p>It has been maintained that the Elias of Scripture&mdash;the
great herald and harbinger&mdash;in some way
represented the sun, Helios, and in modern Greece
that luminary is personified, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Elias is supposed
to preside over the rainfall. The churches to this
saint stand on the sites of ancient temples to Apollo,
and here at Winchester we have a cathedral close to
the site of a temple of Apollo, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Swithun, who regulates the weather.</p>

<p>Æthelwold acquired the reputation of being a
prophet, in a manner which does not reflect much
credit upon some of his friends. During Lent he
preached a powerful sermon on mortification, telling
the people to abstain from meat, courtship, and other
pleasant things. On hearing this, some wild fellow
among the crowd made a profane jest, and the
bishop, in reply, said that he foresaw his approaching
death. Next morning the offender was found really
dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> “his throat cut by the devil.”</p>

<p>Many bodies of the great were moved by this
bishop, and, in turn, after he himself had been buried,
he was taken up and made to work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Monks’ Success.</div>

<p>In these days of Dunstan there was great activity
in ecclesiastical affairs, a great conflict between the
priests and monks. The authority of the Pope, which
had not been hitherto fully recognized by the English
Church, was now established. We are told that the
canons of Winchester shirked the trouble of chanting,
consumed in country residences the goods of the
Church, and deputed their duties to poorly-paid
vicars. “<cite class="plain">The Golden History</cite>” states that the canons
were in the habit of turning off the wives they had
illicitly taken, and taking others, and were guilty of
gluttony and drunkenness. Such were the charges
made against them by the monks, and the King
turned out the canons of the old and new monasteries
(<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun’s and Hyde); but it may be observed
that in the early English Church marriage of priests
was not forbidden. We read that at the New Monastery
all the canons were in 968 called on to take the
Benedictine habit, “and robes and cowls were brought
into the choir,” Dunstan having established the Benedictines
in England. But the old clergy were not
without friends, and determined not to yield without
a struggle. A great meeting was held in the refectory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of the old monastery. All the magnates of the
country came to support the dispossessed canons;
on the other side were Oswald, Archbishop of York,
Æthelwold, Bishop of Winchester, and the monks.
Dunstan sat next to King Edgar, who had his back
to the wall, whereon was a cross, placed there it is
remarked, in the days of Ethelred, when the
canons first succeeded the slaughtered monks. The
temporal lords now promised that the canons would
reform their manners, and begged for their restitution.
Edgar was moved by their “sighs and tears,”
and was about to consent, when Dunstan’s genius,
heaven-born or not, came to the assistance of the
monks. A voice suddenly came from an image on
the cross behind Edgar, “Let this not be; ye have
judged well. Ye may not change for the better.”
Edgar and Dunstan alone heard the voice. They
were struck dumb, and fell to the ground. The voice
was then heard a second time: “Arise, fear not, for
justice and peace have kissed each other in the
monks.”</p>

<p>“It is evident that the speaker, whoever he was,
had no sense of the ludicrous,” said Mr. Hertford.</p>

<p>“We are led,” I added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> “to think of the peculiar
orifice there is in the Castle Hall just behind the
daïs.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cathedral Treasures.</div>

<p>When the Danes obtained the sovereignty the
butter-boat of the monks was still safe. Cnut enriched
the Cathedral with a mass of gold and silver
and of jewels, the brilliance of which “frightened
strangers.” His own crown, either in his lifetime, or
more probably after his body had lain in State before
the high altar, was placed on the head of the Saviour,
on the Cross which stood here. He gave a splendid
shrine for Birinus, and a silver candelabrum with six
branches. A magnificent golden cross, two large
images of gold and silver, and shrines for relics were
also bestowed.<a name="Anchor_65" id="Anchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 65.">[65]</a> Much of this munificence was suggested
by his queen, Emma, who was a devotee.<a name="Anchor_66" id="Anchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 66.">[66]</a>
She had Alwyn, a relation of her own, made Bishop
of Winchester. Perhaps her partiality for this monastery
caused some jealousy, for after her son, Edward
the Confessor, had been crowned here in 1042, she
was accused of being improperly familiar with the
bishop, of consenting to the death of her son, Alfred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and of opposing Edward’s accession. The King
himself came down here in disguise to watch her,
and soon her treasury in Winchester was seized, and
she was compelled to retire to the convent of Wherwell.
We are told that she felt greatly her reduced
circumstances, “because the worst part of poverty was
that it made people contemptible.” A memorable, if
not legendary, scene is now recorded by Rudborne.
“Emma the Lady,” once the “Flower of Normandy,”
demands to have her innocence tried by walking over
red-hot ploughshares. The day draws near. She
spends the night in prayers and tears, and in visiting
the tomb of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun: the saint bids her be of good
courage. Next morning a crowd of clergy and laity
collect in the Cathedral; the King is in his State
robes. Nine dreadful red-hot ploughshares are
brought forth. The Queen advances and addresses
the King. “My lord and son, I, Emma, that bore
you, accused before you of crimes against you and
Alfred, my son, and of base conduct with Alwyn the
bishop, call God to witness in my person whether I
have had in my mind any of these things attributed
to me.” She then throws off her outer robe and takes
off her shoes. A tremor of terror passes through the
vast multitude, and the cry rends the air, “<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun,
save her!” Rudborne does not minimize it; he says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that it was so loud that the saint must have come
then or never. “Heaven suffers violence, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Swithun is dragged down by force”&mdash;such are his
words. Thus encouraged, the Queen advances between
two bishops, and walks over the ploughshares,
with her eyes turned towards heaven, exclaiming,
“God, who delivered Susannah from the wicked old
men, and the boys from the furnace, deliver me, for
the sake of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun.” She seemed to be walking
“on roses,” and so little did she feel the fire that
when all was over she asked when the trial was to
begin!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ordeal by Fire.</div>

<p>We cannot spoil the prettiest picture in Winchester’s
history by a suggestion of falsehood or
over-colouring. One of the ploughshares is said to
have been afterwards found; and, as to the feat, there
was no difficulty, for was she not treading on ground
radiant with miracles?</p>

<p>Under the Conqueror and Rufus the Cathedral
was rebuilt, with the exception of the tower, by his
kinsman, Walkelin. This bishop was an estimable
man, and possessed such an unusual disposition that,
although ascetic himself, he was tolerant to others.
Never was he known to speak a harsh word, and, it
is said, that he loved the monks “as if they were
divinities.” The man who built this great edifice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
much of whose work still remains, neither ate fish nor
flesh.</p>

<p>“The vegetarians ought to be proud of him,”
observed Mr. Hertford.</p>

<p>“And the teetotalers,” I continued, “will be glad
to hear that he very seldom touched wine or beer.
His end was sad. Rufus demanded <abbr title="200 pounds">£200</abbr> from him,
and he knowing that he could not obtain that sum
without oppressing the poor or despoiling the Church,
prayed that he might die; and we are told that ten
days afterwards his prayer was granted, but we hear
no details about it. His brother Simeon, at one time
prior here, was of an equally genial disposition.
Being shocked at the sight of the monks devouring
meat on the fast days, he ordered some fish to be
exquisitely cooked and set before them. The
brethren relished the dish so much that they said
they never wished to eat meat any more, and by
this savoury device the worthy prior enabled them
to indulge their appetites without endangering their
souls.”</p>

<p>How it must have grieved the soul of Walkelin
to be associated with such a creature as Ralph
Flambard, who was a contrast to him in everything!
When the King went abroad the entire government
of the country was committed to these two opposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
spirits. Flambard was unscrupulous and ingenious,
and but for the injury done to religion there would
seem to have been something almost comic in his
career. Rufus, whose chaplain he was, never tired
of heaping promotion upon one as unprincipled as
himself. He was made Abbot of Hyde at Winchester,
Bishop of Chichester, and Bishop of Lincoln.
Many of the churches under his supervision were
without priests or ministrations, and such were his
exactions from rich and poor that they “did not
care whether they were dead or alive.” This genius
was thrown into prison by Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> when he came to
the throne, but was too slippery for him: soon made
his escape, and was over in Normandy abetting Duke
Robert, who had a right to the English crown, and
managing affairs so skilfully that upon a temporary
reconciliation between the brothers, Flambard was
received back and made Bishop of Durham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scandals.</div>

<p>A few years later the bishop’s misdoings became
so notorious that reports of them reached Rome, and
the Pope’s legate, John de Crema, was directed to
visit the diocese and make inquiries. Flambard
was equal to the occasion. He received the legate
with great ceremony, and entertained him at a
sumptuous banquet. While the bowl was flowing,
he introduced him to his niece, whom he instructed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
do her best to captivate him. John, who it seems had
not the gifts of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, was soon “with love
and wine at once oppressed,” fell into the trap, and
finally arranged with the fair deceiver to come to his
room. She kept her promise only too faithfully.
But scarcely had she entered when in rushed the
bishop with a crowd of priests and acolytes carrying
lamps and goblets, and calling out “Benedicite,
benedicite! we congratulate you on your marriage&mdash;drink&mdash;we
drink your health!” The legate was
overwhelmed with confusion. Before daybreak he
was up and off on his way to Rome leaving the gay
bishop and his peccadilloes to take care of themselves.<a name="Anchor_67" id="Anchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">[67]</a></p>

<p>The history of this Cathedral has not been entirely
one of peace. In 1188 armed men were brought into
it, who, at the instigation of certain nobles, “not afraid
to lift their hands against God’s anointed, dragged
forth some of God’s servants.” In 1274, Andrew,
Prior of Winchester, came here with a body of armed
men. Sentinels were placed by the bishop to prevent
their entering, and the prior made an attack on the
third day. The bishop called his adherents together,
barricaded the Cathedral, and excommunicated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
prior. The King hearing of this immediately sent
down justiciaries, and cooled by terms of imprisonment
the “anger in celestial minds.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Construction.</div>

<p>By the time two hundred and fifty years had
elapsed, Walkelin’s nave had become somewhat dilapidated,
and Bishop Edington undertook its renovation.
He built the west porch and one of the westernmost
windows in the south aisle and two in the north.
Wykeham carried on the good work for ten years, till
his death in 1404, having commenced it as a septuagenarian.
He finished the south aisle and began
the north, and left 500 marks to glaze the windows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
His work was that of adaptation&mdash;pulling down the
triforium and casing the pillars. Portions of the old
Norman pillars, then concealed by chapels, can still
be seen near the stairs to the choir.</p>

<p>The work of construction was finished by Cardinal

demolition.</p>

<p>“Thomas did us more harm than Oliver”&mdash;such is

<p>Bishop Horne, who died in 1580, and was buried
near Bishop Edington’s chantry, was a detrimental
reformer. To make himself conspicuous in taking
what appeared to be the winning side he did a
great amount of damage to the Cathedral, not only
removing crucifix, images, and paintings, but actually
knocking down the cloisters and chapter-house. A
few arches on the back of the Deanery still remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
sad memorials of these buildings, and of his misdirected
zeal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civil War.</div>

<p>Much damage, but of a more petty character, was
done here by the Roundhead soldiery during the
Civil War. In the middle of December, 1642, the
city, having been taken by Waller, was pillaged and
the Cathedral doors burst open. “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">As if they meant
to invade God Himself as well as His profession</span>,”
writes <cite class="plain">Mercurius</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">they enter the Church with colours
flying, drums beating, matches fired; and that all
might have their part in so horrid an attempt, some
of their troops of horse also accompanied them in
their march, and rode up through the body of the
church and choir until they came to the altar: there
they begin their work, they rudely plucked down the
table and break the rail, and afterwards carried it to
an alehouse; they set it on fire, and in that fire burnt
the books of Common Prayer, and all the singing
books belonging to the choir; they throw down the
organ and break the stones of the Old and New
Testament, curiously cut out in carved work, beautified
with colours, and set round about the top of the
stalls of the choir; from hence they turn to the
monuments of the dead, some they utterly demolish,
others they deface. They begin with Bishop Fox’s
chapel which they utterly deface, they break all the
glass windows of this chapel not because they had
any pictures in them, but because they were of
coloured glass, they demolished and overturned the
monuments of Cardinal Beaufort, they deface the
monument of William of Wayneflet, Bishop of Winchester,
Lord Chancellor of England, and founder of
Magdalen College, Oxford. From thence they go
into Queen Mary’s Chapel, so called because in it she
was married to King Philip of Spain; here they
break the communion table in pieces, and the velvet
chair whereon she sat when she was married.</span>” After
speaking of the chests containing the bones of kings
and others, the narrative proceeds: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">But these
monsters of men to whom nothing is holy, nothing
sacred, did not stick to profane and violate these
cabinets of the dead, and to scatter their bones all
over the pavement of the church; for on the north
side of the choir they threw down the chests wherein
were deposited the bones of the bishops; the like
they did to the bones of William Rufus, of Queen
Emma, of Harthacnut, and of Edward the Confessor,
and were going on to practise the same impiety
on the bones of all the rest of the West Saxon kings.
But the outcry of the people detesting so great inhumanity,
caused some of their commanders to come
in amongst them and to restrain their madness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Those windows which they could not reach with their
weapons they broke by throwing at them the bones
of kings and saints. They broke off the swords from
the brass statues of James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> and Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, which
then stood at the entrance to the choir, breaking also
the cross on the globe in the hand of Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, and
hacked and hewed the crown on the head of it,
swearing they would bring him back to his Parliament....
After all this, as if what they had already
done were all too little, they go on in their horrible
wickedness, they seize upon all the communion plate,
the Bibles and service books, rich hangings, large
cushions of velvet, all the pulpit cloths, some whereof
were of cloth of silver, some of cloth of gold. And
now, having ransacked the church, and defied God in
His own house and the king in his own statue,
having violated the urns of the dead, having abused
the bones and scattered the ashes of deceased
monarchs, bishops, saints, and confessors, they return
in triumph bearing their spoils with them. The
troopers (because they were the most conspicuous)
ride through the streets in surplices with such hoods
and tippets as they found, and that they might boast
to the world how glorious a victory they had achieved
they hold out their trophies to all spectators, for
the troopers thus clad in the priests’ vestments, rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
carrying Common Prayer books in one hand and
some broken organ pipes, together with the mangled
pieces of carved work in the other.</span>”<a name="Anchor_69" id="Anchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">[69]</a></p>

<p>We accordingly made our way down the High

stopped before entering the graveyard to visit Mr.
Chalkley’s, the taxidermist’s&mdash;which may be
regarded as a kind of “dead-alive” place. Here
are the beautiful remains of natives of many sunny
climes. Can we suppose that such little beings with

butchery below, a theatre above. There were plenty
of stalls here, containing, not cushions, but meat, and
along them and at the corners stood strong oaken

<p>We now approach the Cathedral, through the

were planted by Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, and let us hope that
was the case, for he is the last monarch around

certainly a design to connect the Palace with the

frame.”</p>

<p>“This was the work of Bishop Edington,” I
observed, “begun about 1345. He did not like the
‘dim religious light’ of the Middle Ages.”</p>

<p>What a different front did the Norman knights
here behold; something as stern and cold as their
own iron armour. A vast blank face of masonry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
rose before them, broken only by a few plain,
round-headed windows, without even a pane of glass
to reflect the setting sun.<a name="Anchor_71" id="Anchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 71.">[71]</a> There is proof from
excavations, and some remains in the wall of the
garden on the south, that some kind of portico was
commenced in front of the present façade, with a
tower forty feet square at either end, but that the
work was abandoned a few feet above ground. The
interior was also severe. The pillars indeed were
about the same size and height as those we now
see&mdash;their Norman terminations still remain under
the roof&mdash;and the eight westernmost on the south
side have not been even re-cased, but only slightly
chiselled into rounder form. But they did not
originally break into graceful fans upon the
vaulting, nor were there between them lofty arches
crowned with ornamental windows. No; the
spaces were occupied by three tiers of low, round
arches, producing a monotonous effect, such as we
still see in the transepts. The vaulting of the
side aisles was also low and heavy, supporting the
deep triforium gallery. The whole structure had a
Spartan simplicity and strength characteristic of a
rude age. It terminated eastward in an apse under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the place where now glows the stained-glass window
of Bishop Fox.<a name="Anchor_72" id="Anchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 72.">[72]</a></p>

<p>Such was the building to which the body of
Rufus “dropping blood” was brought by night
in a peasant’s cart, and where it was buried with
little lamentation. Seven years afterwards the
great tower fell, because, as the monks thought,
it could not bear to have such a wicked man
buried under it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Nave.</div>

<p>On entering, the full effect of the great length
and height is felt.<a name="Anchor_73" id="Anchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">[73]</a> We seem to be looking down

<p>High in front of us under the eastern gable stands
the glorious window erected by Bishop Fox, in the
reign of Henry <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>, when the staining of glass
reached a supreme excellence never before or
afterwards attained. It would appear from the
fragments in the aisle windows that they were all
at one time coloured, but the Roundheads smashed
them, and the pieces collected were placed in the
west window, where they form a sort of farrago
or confusion&mdash;an edifying emblem of the destructive
results of revolution.<a name="Anchor_74" id="Anchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">[74]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On either side just within the main entrance stands
the figure of a king. They have a somewhat Ethiopian
appearance and I took them for the sovereigns of
Arabia and Saba. But they really represent the
First James and Charles. They seem to be
handling their sceptres in a very formidable
manner, as if they had still Waller’s rabble in
front of them; and we read that they had swords,
which were broken off by the rebels. These
figures have a family likeness to that at Charing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Cross, which was by the same man, Le Soeur. They
were placed by Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> in front of the rood screen
of Inigo Jones. That monarch “of blessed memory”
also moved the organ to the side, so that an uninterrupted
view could be obtained up the Cathedral.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Font.</div>

<p>On the right-hand side stands the celebrated
font&mdash;a heavy mass of black basalt, supposed to
be Byzantine, and of the same character as that
at East Meon. The figures on it have a little the
appearance of marionettes, and there is, in truth,
some unreality about the representation which
records the miracles of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas. A monk has
written an account of the events here brought before
us&mdash;how <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas saved three virgins from disgrace,
stilled a storm, restored a sailor to life,
healed the sick, and saved three condemned men.
Death itself could not stop the saint’s beneficence,
for after his decease he restored a child who had
fallen overboard with a golden cup. Behind the
font on the wall of the north aisle are memorials
to two remarkable women. Miss Austen is still
thought by some of the old school to be the queen
of novelists, and the fact that her works are still
published proves their merit.</p>

<p>“I like ‘Pride and Prejudice’ very much,” said
Miss Hertford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The other lady here commemorated, Mrs. Montagu,
was a Shakspearian, lived among the learned and
eminent, and founded the Blue Stocking Club.</p>

<p>“I remember well the house she built,” replied Mr.
Hertford; “it stood like a respectable old country
house in its garden in Portman Square, and has
been enlarged into Lord Portman’s mansion. She
covered her drawing-room walls with feathers, as
Cowper writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">What a gay May-day the sweeps had with their
ribbons, flowers, and feasting in the good lady’s
time! We read on this tablet that she had ‘the
united advantages of beauty, wit, judgment, reputation,
and riches.’”</p>

<p>“What a happy woman!” exclaimed Miss Hertford.
“I once heard a girl asked which she would rather
be&mdash;handsome, clever, or rich. The questioner never
imagined that any one could be all three.”</p>

<p>Higher up on the same side, near the stairs, is
a memorial to Boles, the Royalist “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Collonell of a
Ridgment of Foot who did <i>wounders</i> at the Battle
of Edgehill.</span>” No doubt he did, for when finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
he was, with eighty men, surrounded by five thousand
rebels in the church at Alton, he held out for six
hours, and after killing six or seven with his own
sword was himself slain with sixty of his men.</p>

<p>“Winchester is rich in monuments,” I said. “It
preceded Westminster as the burial-place of the
great and has, with that exception, more human
interest than any other sacred edifice in England.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wykeham’s Chantry.</div>

<p>On the opposite side of the Nave stands the
Chantry of Wykeham, of great height and beautiful
elaboration.<a name="Anchor_75" id="Anchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 75.">[75]</a> It happens by design or accident that
if we supposed our Lord’s body to be lying on
the cross of the original Cathedral, the site of
this monument would correspond with the wound
in His side. This was the favourite spot at which
Wykeham prayed when a boy, before an altar to
the Virgin; and here he built his tomb, on which
his figure has reposed for nearly five hundred years,
and where it may remain for five hundred more. The
good he did was not destined to be “interred with
his bones,” and the line on the resting-place of Wren,
whose truth impresses the reader, might without
impropriety have been also engraved here&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si monumentum quæras, circumspice.</span>”
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>
<p>It is the rare privilege of Winchester to have here,
face to face in the Palace and Cathedral, two of the
most important works of these great master builders.</p>

<p>Higher up the nave is the Chantry of Bishop
Edington, earlier and less ornamental than that of
Wykeham. He is the prelate who was offered the
Archbishopric of Canterbury and made the shrewd
and sportive reply, “If Canterbury is the higher
rank, Winchester is the better manger.” The date
is placed in a fanciful way at the end of the inscription
“M thrice C with <abbr class="spell">LXV</abbr> and I.”</p>

<p>On the bishop’s vestment there is a curious
emblem of a cruciform shape, called a Fylfot or
Suastika. It is stated to signify submission to the
will of God, and to have been a symbol prior to
Christianity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tomb of Rufus.</div>

<p>From this point we wander into the Choir, and
admire the tall carved spires of oak, blackened by
the airs of six centuries. A verger turns up the
seats to show us the quaint carvings of an age
when humour did not seem distasteful in churches&mdash;here
is a pig playing the fiddle, another chanting,
and a third blowing the trumpet. In the centre
of the pavement lies the sphinx of the Cathedral&mdash;rude,
archaic, enigmatical. It has been surmised
to be the tomb of some royal Saxon, or of Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
de Blois. Winchester men continue to swear it is
that of Rufus, who was “buried in the choir,” but
that king’s bones seem, from an inscription on one
of the neighbouring coffers, to have been chested
and perched up by Fox. Everything about it is
a puzzle. The rebels in the Civil War broke it
open and found a silver chalice, a gold ring, and
pieces of cloth of gold, within it. This has led to
the supposition that De Blois rested here. In 1868
it was again opened, and one of the vergers told
me he had handled the bones, had seen beside
them the arrow-head with which the king was
killed, and had remarked what an excellent set
of teeth he possessed. Remains of cloth of gold
and other tissues were discovered, and seven gold
Norman braids finely worked, as we can see in the
library, where they are preserved.<a name="Anchor_76" id="Anchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">[76]</a></p>

<p>The altar screen must have been most effective
when the figures remained. Dean Kitchin has
given a tantalizing account of it, and during the
Civil War a wall was built before it. But throughout
the last century, the niches were filled with
modern vases, the gift of an excellent prebendary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Master Harris, whose zeal was greater than his
taste.</p>

<p>Leaving the learned to fight the dusty battle of
Rufus and De Blois, we make our way to the
iron gate, and each deposit the silver obolus to
admit us to the realms of the departed. Here a
group of visitors is waiting, and we look up at
the interesting Norman work in the south transept.
There are good reasons for supposing that the
transepts were not built continuously&mdash;a change
of plan can be traced&mdash;and it would seem that
there was at one time an intention of placing a
couple of towers at the end of each transept. The
great central tower also was erected later&mdash;after
Walkelin’s death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Isaak Walton.</div>

<p>Just before me stands an old oak settle, perhaps
nearly coeval with the transept. How many generations
of monks have sat on it and warmed their
withered hands over a pan of charcoal! I could
almost imagine that on certain days their ghosts
may perambulate their old haunts, and seat themselves
here again. In the centre of the transept
lies Bishop Wilberforce. On the east side is Prior
Silkstede’s Chapel, as it is called. It is now a vestry,
and here Isaak Walton is literally trodden under
foot. In answer to my inquiries, the verger pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
up the matting and showed his slab inscribed with
Bishop Ken’s<a name="Anchor_77" id="Anchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">[77]</a> verses. They are not worthy of the
author of the morning and evening hymns. They
inform us that he lived&mdash;</p>

<p>Isaak was an erect, hale old man to the last. He
was a theologian, and we hear that to atone for long
neglect, a statue to him is about to be placed on the
screen, beside the saintly Fishermen.</p>

<p>“I wish that Andrews, Bishop of Winchester,
had been buried here,” said Mr. Hertford, “and
that we had an epitaph on him by Milton. The
elegiacs he wrote on his death were as beautiful
as ‘Lycidas.’”</p>

<p>And now all are ready, and we advance along
the aisle behind the choir, and come in sight of
the “presbytery screen,” some arches surmounted
by coffers, which look like small locomotives on
a railway viaduct. All this was the work of Fox,
who was bishop in the reigns of the Henrys (<abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>). He built the clerestory and vaulting
of this part. We look up at the roof and remark
the bosses exhibiting the Tudor arms and other
heraldic emblems dear to Fox; while beyond, in
the vaulting of Bishop Lucy, the devices are more
scriptural, including not only the instruments of
the Passion, but the faces of Pilate and his better
half, and Peter’s sword with Malchus’ ear upon it.</p>

<p>The bones of the Saxon kings and bishops
buried in the Cathedral, had been well dried and
preserved, having been placed in stone coffins pierced
with holes. Fox piously collected them into these
chests, on which he inscribed the venerated names
of their owners.<a name="Anchor_78" id="Anchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">[78]</a> He hoisted them up, having
great confidence in the safety gained by elevation,
and his trust was justified, with regard to his
window in the gable and his statue above it, but
in respect of these chests, he did not rightly measure
the height to which mob violence might attain.
After the storm had passed away, the bones were
collected and replaced, but no one knew what
remains were stored in any particular chest. A
small set of bones has been thought to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
belonged to Queen Emma. There are twelve names,
and as late as 1845, the confused contents were all
safe; but by 1873, one of the twelve skulls was
gone.</p>

<p>“Purloined, perchance, by some over-zealous
phrenologist, whose principles were not more sound
than his theories,” said Mr. Hertford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fox’s Chantry.</div>

<p>We now come to Fox’s Chantry, and admire the
diversified stone carving of the exterior. It is most
refined and in the best taste, while the figure of
Death stretched beneath it is in the worst, and
reminds us of the skull and cross-bones, with which
headstones were formerly adorned. We enter, and
think we can see the dark ascetic bishop kneeling
in his little stone study, for hither when blind, in
his old age, he was led daily for prayer. His
memory will ever be cherished lovingly here, and
in Oxford, where he founded Corpus Christi College.
Through this chantry, we reach the Feretory (from
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feretra</i>, biers). Here, in ancient times, the gold and
silver shrines of Birinus, Swithun, and other saints,
the head of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, and one of the feet of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Philip, stood upon a platform higher than the present
one, and reflected a holy light upon the worshippers
in the choir. The contents of the feretory are now
not so brilliant, though interesting. Here lies a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
prostrate giant&mdash;a figure of Bishop Edington&mdash;which
was once perched up over the west front,
but becoming dilapidated, was replaced by that
of Wykeham. Here is the lid, or side of a reliquary
chest (1309) with sacred subjects painted
on its panels. The other remains are melancholy
to behold, heads and portions of the bodies of
statues found about the Cathedral.</p>

<p>“It looks like an old curiosity shop, or a
sculptor’s studio,” observed Miss Hertford.</p>

<p>“And it reminds me,” chimed in her father, “of
a story I heard about some country labourers, who
had been visiting the British Museum. When asked
how they liked it, they said, ‘Very much, but
some had no arms, some had no legs, and some
had no heads. The butler, however, was very kind,
and told us it was intended to represent a railway
accident.’”</p>

<p>On the other side of this feretory is Gardiner’s
Chantry. He is generally associated in our minds
with fire and faggot, but when we first read
of him, he was a young man at Paris, chiefly
remarkable for his skill in mixing salads. How
unfortunate that he did not confine himself to this
cooler occupation!&mdash;he would at least have received
the blessings of epicures. Why should we recall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the ghastly past? Gardiner’s violent Catholicism
was partly from jealousy of Cranmer. Had he been
made archbishop, he might have been a reformer;
for there was a time when he was in Rome brow-beating
the Pope, on behalf of Anne Boleyn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death’s Effigy.</div>

<p>The only good act the rebels did in the Cathedral
was done here; they knocked the head off the
wretched figure of Death, which had been placed,
I suppose, as a companion in misery for that in
Fox’s Chantry opposite. Perhaps the poet Young,
had these scarecrows, which he knew well, in his
mind, when he wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line_i22">“Who can take</div>
    <div class="p_line">Death’s portrait true? The tyrant never sat.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The mob would, doubtless, have turned out
Gardiner’s remains had not some pious Catholics put
a skull and bones above them, which were mistaken
for the bishop’s. They would have been glad to
have put him again to destructive work, not indeed,
destroying heretics, but breaking to pieces the
saints in the stained-glass windows. In this chantry
there is still to be seen a portion of one of the
round pillars of the Norman apse.</p>

<p>Returning through Fox’s Chantry, and proceeding
eastward, we enter the large retro-choir built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in the beautiful Early English style by Bishop
de Lucy about seventy years after Walkelin’s
time. It is erected on piles, so we may be
thankful it has stood so long. Immediately at
the back of the feretory, we see an arch leading
to “the holy hole”&mdash;or, as some of our companions
called it, “the ’oly ’ole”&mdash;in which interments
formerly took place. An attempt was made to
enter it in 1789, but the masonry had fallen down
and the enterprise was relinquished. The Edwardian
canopies over it are charming. The area in which
we stand is studded with tombs. There are two
splendid chantries here&mdash;one of Bishop Wayneflete,
the founder of Magdalen College, Oxford; and the
other, of Cardinal Beaufort. Wayneflete is represented
as grasping his heart.<a name="Anchor_79" id="Anchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">[79]</a> Both monuments
have suffered. Wayneflete’s head was so much
damaged that a new one was lately given him.
Beaufort’s figure is supposed not to be original, and
“a horse-load of pinnacles” had by Milner’s time<a name="Anchor_80" id="Anchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">[80]</a>
fallen or been knocked off this canopy of “bewildering”
embellishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>An old gentleman of our company inquired whether
Cardinal Beaufort was a Roman Catholic, and I could
see by his countenance that the affirmative answer he
received greatly altered his opinion of that eminent
man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Altar Tombs.</div>

<p>The other monuments are “altar tombs,” comparatively
insignificant, being only two or three feet
above the pavement. But to our eyes they seemed
a promising array, and proved disappointing. We
had read that among others Prior William of
Basynge, Sir Arnald de Gaveston, Prior Silkstede
and Bishop Courtenay were lying here. On the
first we came to, that of Basynge, I deciphered the
pleasant announcement that whoever prays for him
shall obtain a hundred and forty-five days’ indulgence.</p>

<p>“That seems,” observed Mr. Hertford, “as if he
was not so anxious about the souls of others as about
his own.”</p>

<p>The ledger-stone which bears this inscription is
the only genuine part of the tomb.</p>

<p>Then we come to the line of four tombs extending
from the Edwardian Arcade to the Lady Chapel.
First, there is the goodly figure of Bishop Sumner,
whose snow-white marble looks out of place among
the dark tones of distant centuries; he is not buried
here. Next to this is a tomb of some bishop of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
fifteenth century, not that of Silkstede&mdash;a nearly
perfect skeleton in black serge and funeral boots
was found in it. Then we come to the only ancient
knight who makes a figure in the Cathedral. He is
in armour, with his legs crossed, which denotes some
rank. Surely this is Sir Arnald de Gaveston, the
Gascon knight who saved Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>’s life. When
he died the King sent cloth of gold for his funeral.</p>

<p>But no, he was buried in the north transept. This
is supposed to represent William de Foix.</p>

<p>“Whoever he is Time has pulled him by the nose
a little,” said Mr. Hertford; “but he always loves to
deride the greatness of man.”</p>

<p>“He would have had a better excuse,” I returned,
“had he treated the delightful ‘Piers’ in this unhandsome
manner.”<a name="Anchor_81" id="Anchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">[81]</a></p>

<p>“Why, not one of these tombs has the ring of
truth about it,” said Mr. Hertford, discontentedly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peter de la Roche.</div>

<p>“Well this last one next the Lady Chapel is
genuine,” I replied. “It is that of Bishop de Lucy,
but was long asserted by an easy and patriotic error
to be that of Lucius, the British king. The occupant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of the tomb immediately to the north of Bishop
Sumner is unknown, but to the north-east lies
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Petrus de Rupibus</span>. Few would understand without
a teacher that this meant Peter de la Roche, but in
that age the manner in which names were Latinized
raises a suspicion that some jesters were engaged in
the work. Thus we find Montagu rendered ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de
Monte acuto</span>;’ and in this Cathedral we have the
grave of ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Johannes de Pontissara</span>,’ <i>i.e.</i>, John Sawbridge.”<a name="Anchor_82" id="Anchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82.">[82]</a></p>

<p>“Much more mellifluous,” observed Mr. Hertford.
“But one might almost say to them as Quince said
to Bottom in the ass’s head, ‘Bless me! thou art
translated.’”</p>

<p>“Peter de la Roche,” I continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> “was a native
of Poictiers, and had served in youth under Richard
Cœur de Lion. He became Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>’s guardian
and tutor, and seemed at one time to have all the
kingly power at his command. As a bishop he
supported the Papal authority against the national
party, which was represented by Hubert de Burgh.
When unsuccessful he ‘took the cross’&mdash;went to
the Crusades. Afterwards he returned, presented the
monastery with one of the feet of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Philip, and was
able to entertain Henry sumptuously at Wolvesey
Castle. He became the head of the Government,
founded the Dominican Convent at the Eastgate,
and built (or suggested)<a name="Anchor_83" id="Anchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">[83]</a> Netley Abbey, and the
great North ‘Solomon’s’ porch at Westminster. On
the southern wall of this area is a monument to Sir
John Cloberry&mdash;representing him as a kind of ‘fat
boy,’ with a long curly wig. He was an officer under
Monk, and contributed to bring about the Restoration.
His house was in Parchment Street.”</p>

<p>Further on, at the extreme east, we come to Bishop
Langton’s Chantry (he died in 1500). This and the
next chapel is beautifully enriched with oak carving.
Next to this we enter the Lady Chapel, by building
which Priors Hunton and Silkstede made this the
longest cathedral in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mary and Philip.</div>

<p>A gleam of gold and jewellery comes to us here
from 1554. We were told that in this Lady Chapel
Mary and Philip were married, but there is no doubt
that the ceremony was performed before the high
altar, which seemed the proper place. The chair in
which Mary sat is here, and has originated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
claim of the chapel. It is small, with a low back&mdash;a
faldistorium&mdash;of a form not then uncommon, but
was brave with brass nails, gilding, and velvet. It has
now a shabby and melancholy appearance, like the
performances of the sovereign who sat in it; the
horse-hair is coming out, and no wonder, for nearly
every second lady visitor poses in it as the queen
of the moment.</p>

<p>But let us look at something better. The light of
love is in the eyes of the gloomy bride, and is even
slightly reflected from the dark, underhung visage of
the king. All the nobility are gathered from the
whole of England. The Queen in cloth of gold,
with the sword borne before her, sweeps up with
a long retinue from the west entrance, and takes her
place on the “Mount,” beneath the rood loft. On
her left is Philip, also in cloth of gold, having beside
him a large number of nobles of Spain. Golden
hangings glow in the choir, and at the altar stand six
bishops with their crosiers. But with all this brilliancy
none could fail to see the dark cloud of popular
discontent lowering in the sky, and alas! the golden
apparel concealed a sad and a false heart.</p>

<p>In this Lady Chapel, which has such high pretensions,
the remains of some old frescoes (Silkstede’s)
long covered with paint and plaster, are still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
visible. There are twenty-four separate designs, all
in honour of the Virgin. In one place a young man
puts a gold ring on the Virgin’s finger to keep it till
he sees his lady-love. When he returns for it he
finds it will not come off. He does not attribute this
to the trickery of the monks, but to the intervention
of the Virgin, and forthwith jilts his sweetheart and
takes the cowl. In another design a painter accustomed
to represent the devil “as ugly as he knew him
to be,” is executing on a high wall, a figure of Our
Lady, with the devil under her feet. His artistic
work is stopped by a dragon-like fiend pulling down
his scaffolding, when lo! the Virgin he has just
painted holds out her hand to him and supports
him till assistance arrives. Here also we have John
Damascen, a celebrated writer of the eighth century,
condemned by Saracen Caliph to lose his right
hand. The peccant member is cut off, and hung up
in the market-place, but on its being taken down
and applied to the wrist with prayers to the Virgin,
it is reunited.</p>

<p>“What absurd stories,” said Miss Hertford. “I
wonder how even a child could have believed them.”</p>

<p>“I did not credit them,” I replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span> “but now that
I see framed on the wall that wonderful restoration
of these indistinct outlines, I may think that the
miraculous power of the Virgin is still present in her
chapel.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rebuses.</div>

<p>Those who deem that a person guilty of a pun
should suffer imprisonment will not look with much
appreciation on the humour attempted on the vaulting
of this and the last-named chapels. All that can
be said in its behalf is that it has the flavour of a
bygone age. These rebuses seem to us puerile.
There might be a temptation to represent Silkstede
by a skein and a horse; and as Winchester was often
called Winton, and famous for its wine, there might
be something juicy in symbolizing it by a vine
issuing from a tun. But here we have a musical note
termed “long,” coming out of a tun for Langton,
and some can see a hen making a similar egress for
Hunton. The dragon issuing from a tun refers to
<cite class="plain">Proverbs</cite> <abbr title="23">xxiii.</abbr> 31, 32: “<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Look not upon the wine
when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the
cup.... At last it biteth like a serpent and
stingeth like an adder.</span>”</p>

<p>We might be surprised that, when Fox put up the
panelling here, he did not insert his own name in a
similarly humorous manner. Reynard was a known
ecclesiastical emblem, but not a complimentary one&mdash;in
a church carving we find him preaching to a
flock of geese. Our austere bishop would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
shocked at such a representative; he chose the self-sacrificing
pelican.<a name="Anchor_84" id="Anchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">[84]</a></p>

<p>“Playing with words was much in fashion even at a
later epoch,” said Mr. Hertford. “Not a few of our
great families have punning mottoes as ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ver non
semper viret</span>’ for Vernon, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cavendo tutus</span>’ for Cavendish,
and so on.”</p>

<p>“I do not dislike the little conceits here,” I replied;
“it shows that the ascetic monks had something fresh
and green left in them. Perhaps that fine Chantrey
monument is not so much out of place here as some
suppose. Bishop North was a good Christian and a
good cricketer. It is said that sometimes while he
was in the field hitting away, his chaplain was in the
tent bowling hard questions at the candidates for
ordination.”</p>

<p>Our guide now took us into the next or
northernmost chapel, dedicated to the “Guardian
Angels.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing of much interest here?” I
observed, looking around.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” he replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> “except the window.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing remarkable in that?”</p>

<p>“No; except that it was put up by a remarkable
man,” he returned, warmly; “the best dean we could
possibly have&mdash;generous to rich and poor; and yet,”
he added, with a twinkle, “he left a good bit,
<abbr title="50000 pounds">£50,000</abbr>.”</p>

<p>The dean of whom the verger spoke so enthusiastically
lived to be ninety-six. His son became a
dean, lived to be seventy, and died before his father.
Expectant heirs, take note.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethelmar.</div>

<p>Passing westward to the north presbytery aisle we
find an old-fashioned dumpy ship carved over the
grave of Harthacnut.<a name="Anchor_85" id="Anchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">[85]</a> Hard by lies the heart of
Ethelmar, the half-brother of Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> When the
bishop, after landing at Dover, came to Winchester,
the King, who was much at this city, went out to
meet him with a grand procession. Ethelmar seems
to have been an avaricious young man;<a name="Anchor_86" id="Anchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 86.">[86]</a> he was
scarcely elected when he had a conflict with the
Archbishop of Canterbury, and also with the monks
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun. He deposed the prior here because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
he refused to give an account of some property,
and the lawsuit between him and the monks was so
serious that they mortgaged the church of Winchester
for 7,000 marks&mdash;about <abbr title="5000 pounds">£5,000</abbr>. Afterwards
Ethelmar paid off a part of this, and the monks
gave him the Isle of Portland and other property as
compensation. When the Barons held a parliament
here in 1258, Ethelmar was obliged to fly from the
country. He died in Paris when only thirty-four,
and sent over his heart, which perhaps the monks
did not much appreciate. But it proved a “golden
heart” to them in producing miracles. When the
steps of the altar were being lowered it was found
beneath them in a golden cup by a workman, who
kept the cup and placed the heart in this north
aisle.</p>

<p>We now dive down into the crypt, and find it of
grand dimensions, propped with pillars such as we
have just seen a specimen of in Gardiner’s Chantry.
There is still a controversy as to whether this is
Saxon or Norman work. It seems strange that
Walkelin should have made no use of the extensive
excavations and foundations of the previous building,
but history asserts that the old high altar remained
after the new Cathedral was finished, and the best
authority considers that this edifice was entirely new.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
The well in the crypt is thought to have existed
previously, as it is not symmetrically placed with
regard to the pillars. There is still water in it, I was
told. Until lately the floor was much obstructed by
earth&mdash;sixteen loads have been lately removed.
When James Ellis paid his visit about the middle of
the last century, he found “at the end of the crypt a
chapel, but the extent of it I could not examine, as
it was locked up and used as a wine vault.”<a name="Anchor_87" id="Anchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">[87]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Frescoes.</div>

<p>In the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre, just under
the organ, there are some fine frescoes of the
thirteenth century in fair preservation, and in the
north transept, especially in the north-east corner,
there are traces of colour and patterns, and a large
but somewhat faint fresco apparently representing
some monarch. On the ancient rood screen there
were carved and painted figures, and the spires of the
stalls were gilt until the last century.</p>

<p>As we passed down the Cathedral the sun was
setting, and the effect of the rays falling through the
vast west window was magnificent.</p>

<p>Near the entrance on the north side there is a
remarkable door of grille work, thought to be of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
eleventh or twelfth century, perhaps the oldest specimen
in England. It was formerly near the choir,
and the object was, it is said, to keep unsavoury and
diseased pilgrims at a safe distance.</p>

<p>“Perhaps some of them were like the pilgrims in
the East at the present day,” said Mr. Hertford; “it
was not always easy to determine ‘where the dirt
ended and the saint began.’”</p>

Houses.</p>

<p>This day was to be devoted to visiting the
Cathedral library and precincts, and to taking a stroll
about the streets of the city.</p>

<p>We again entered the lime-tree avenue and looked
across the burial ground. A great improvement had
been carried out within the last three years. When
I was last here it was crowded with tombstones
bending over to each other in various stages of decay,
now it presents a pleasant sward as smooth as a
bowling-green. There is a headstone close to the
path recording the gallantry of twenty-three persons
who died in an attempt to save the property of their
master from destruction by fire. Near the south-west
angle of the ground there is a better-known memorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to a less heroic man, who owes his immortality to the
drollery of his epitaph. It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>There seems to have been a great desire among
soldiers to commemorate this hero, or the moral of
his death, for the stone was replaced again in 1802.</p>

<p>As we left this spot I recalled the memory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Saxon, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Brinstan, who was fond of walking here.
He was an excellent man, but of a somewhat melancholy
turn of mind. Every day he washed the feet
of the poor, and every night he would pace up and
down among the tombs saying the <i>Placebo</i> and
<i>Dirige</i>; and we are told that on one occasion when
he finished by saying with emphasis “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Requiescat in
pace</span>,” a chorus as from a multitude of voices came
from the sepulchres pronouncing a loud “Amen.”</p>

<p>“A pious invention,” said Mr. Hertford, “unless,
indeed, some of the monks were playing him a
trick.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roman Pavements.</div>

<p>“Close to this,” I observed, “was found the Roman
pavement in the Museum, about ten feet underground.
Another pavement, part of which can be
seen in front of the Deanery, was discovered (1880)
in one of the western gardens of Dome Alley. The
distance between them was small, but the difference
of depth (four feet) would seem to indicate two
periods of construction. We seldom realize that the
Romans were here three or four hundred years.”</p>

<p>In the wall bounding the graveyard on the south
we noticed an archway. This led down some steps
still remaining into a vaulted crypt (dating from
1400), where dozens of skeletons have been found.
The Dean discovered last autumn some Perpendicular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
groining, and massive buttresses which have probably
supported a chapel where masses were “sayable.”</p>

<p>We now made for the “Slype” Gate, at the south-west
corner of the Cathedral, beside which there is a
fanciful inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>It appears that the public were accustomed to
make the Cathedral a thoroughfare, and therefore
it was thought desirable (about 1630) to open this
slype passage and to put up this notice. But as those
who tramped through the sacred edifice on business
were unlettered porters and labourers, this enigmatical
Latin caution could have been of little use. We,
however, obeyed the direction, and as we passed,
found some more dislocated verses on the opposite
wall giving a similar injunction in a rhyme between
the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">choro</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foro</i>.</p>

<p>“Look at the valerian and harebells on the
Cathedral wall,” said Miss Hertford. “How prettily
they mark out the architectural lines in blue and red.”</p>

<p>After reaching the south entrance we made for the
adjacent transept, and found at the end of it an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
fourteenth-century door and a flight of oaken stairs
leading to the Library. As I was mounting up I
remembered how on my last visit I was conducted by
a tall, handsome man, the principal verger and, I think,
also librarian. He was remarkably courteous and
well informed. On inquiring for him now I heard
that he was no more! He had light curly hair, and
I should have thought him a young man had he not
told me that he had been sworn in as a special
constable with Louis Napoleon at the time of the
Chartist alarms. Lately I saw an extract from <cite>The
Echo</cite>, in which the writer remarked that the vergers
he had met performed their duties in a perfunctory
way, “mere gabblers,” except one at Winchester
Cathedral. My thoughts immediately turned to this
man, but I must say that the other vergers here seem
fully to appreciate the beauties and antiquities of the
place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cathedral Library.</div>

<p>This “library” was built after Bishop Morley’s
death as a receptacle for his bequeathed books. It
might be called a treasury or museum. Here are
two Anglo-Saxon Charters (854, 957). They begin
in Latin, but the writer seems to have become tired,
and to have lapsed into his native Anglo-Saxon
towards the end. One is attested by Alfred when a
boy. How interesting they would have been if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
contained autographs, but it was the custom then for
the scribe to insert the names with crosses against
them, as we should now for illiterate persons. There
is a poetical complexion about these documents
much in keeping with Anglo-Saxon taste. The first
one, after stating that “Christ reigns for ever,” says
that “It is plain to all mortals that all things that are
seen have an end, and those not seen are eternal.
Therefore I Adulf through the clemency of the High
Throned King of....”<a name="Anchor_88" id="Anchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">[88]</a> The other commences:
“Now by vicissitudes doth the fragility of human
life wither, and the circling roll of ages come to
nought.” The Saxons had imagination, they mingled
poetry with piety; thus we read here, “In the name
of Him who in the book of everlasting life in heaven
has written down those with whom in life He is well
pleased. I Athulf,” &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rare Manuscripts.</div>

<p>As we look at these old parchments we think we
can see again the hands of the long-buried monks,
can enter again their spacious monastery, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
we have read such glowing descriptions. There was
a scriptorium, or writing establishment, founded in it
by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun, and rare work was executed here&mdash;witness
that splendid specimen of illumination in
gold and colours, called the “Benedictional of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Athelwold,” made for that bishop.<a name="Anchor_89" id="Anchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">[89]</a> Coming to a
later time we have here preserved the Book of
Zacharias of the twelfth century. But the greatest
treat for the eyes of the bibliophilist is the large folio
Vulgate of that date. It took the monks of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Swithun’s eighty years to complete it; the work progressed
as slowly as the building of a cathedral. The
writing is beautiful, the illuminating as brilliant as if
freshly done&mdash;the gold and deep blue we especially
admired. Quaint were the designs and ideas of that
age. Here is Elijah as he goes up to heaven, drawn
by two red horses, throwing off not only his mantle,
but the rest of his clothes, perhaps the monk thought
they would be superfluous, whilst Elisha below is
catching a blue tunic he has cast down.<a name="Anchor_90" id="Anchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90.">[90]</a> This work
has been bound by Dean Garnier in three volumes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
It fell at some period into the hands of the Philistines,
who cut out several of the beautiful illustrations.</p>

<p>There is an amusing story in connection with this
fine manuscript. Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> showed with regard to it
a spirit in advance of his age. He solicited and
terrified the monks of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun’s into giving it up
to him, and then made it a handsome present to his
favourite monastery at Witham.</p>

<p>“Like the man who was so much moved with a
charity sermon that he put his neighbour’s purse on
the plate,” suggested Mr. Hertford.</p>

<p>“But one of the Winchester brethren,” I added,
“hearing of the splendours of Witham, went to pay
the abbey a visit, and there saw their own Vulgate.
Explanations followed, and the monks of Witham
returned the book.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relics.</div>

<p>The curiosities are not limited to books.<a name="Anchor_91" id="Anchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">[91]</a> Here
are four rings&mdash;one with a large square sapphire,
found in the disputed tomb of Rufus or De Blois.
Another with an oval sapphire belonged to Fox; and
a third was Gardiner’s, engraved with a helmeted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
head, not unsuitable to such a belligerent bishop.
Here is the rusty ring, about three inches wide, which
the Dean lately found when excavating on the site of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun’s tomb&mdash;it may be that of the smith’s
dream. In a case at the other end of the room are
other treasures. Here are coins and a silver penny
of Cnut, found on the north-west of the Cathedral.
Would it could speak and tell us the strange
language it has heard, and the scenes it has witnessed
as it passed about among churls, thanes, and
monks! Here is a case of relics found in “Rufus’s”
tomb, containing some of the seven braids of Norman
pattern which were found in it. One is well preserved.
How exquisitely delicate! It is not a
quarter of an inch in width. They embroidered
finely then, and we hear that the young swells of the
period were almost effeminate in their attire. Silken
robes with gold borders descending to the feet must
have looked quite “Celestial.”</p>

<p>We emerged from the Cathedral by the south
door. The green sward before us did not exist
before Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>’s time, as the space was filled
by a “garth” surrounded with cloisters. The inferiority
of the ornamentation of the Cathedral on this
side when compared with the other is due to the junction
with these buildings. Bishop Horne destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
them, because he wished to be in keeping with the
times. Cromwell demolished nine prebendal houses
and the deanery.</p>

<p>We now passed through the tunnel at the extremity
of the south transept, and proceeding beyond
the eastern end of the Cathedral saw a wall in front
of us bounding the precincts, and in it a small arch
now filled up. Through this we fancy we can see the
piquant figure of Nell Gwynne passing, for it is said
to have been made to enable her to have access to
the Deanery, where Charles was wont to stay. When
Ken was a prebendary here he stoutly refused to give
up his house to her, and it is one of many instances
of Charles’ good humour that when the bishopric of
Bath and Wells fell vacant, he appointed “the good
little man who refused his lodging to poor Nell.”
There was a small building (long removed) put up for
her to the south of the Deanery, called Nell Gwynne’s
Tower, but she had a house through the arch above
mentioned. Until lately its broad staircases were
the admiration of the people in Colebrook Street,
but it has disappeared within the last few years, and
its site is occupied by an establishment of chimney
sweeps! Thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">

  </div>
 </div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p>Returning to the cloisters’ site we observe on the
east some ruinous remains of the chapter-house. It
was twenty-five or thirty feet wide by twice that in
length, an ancient form which existed before the
more beautiful circular chapter-houses were adopted.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="image_deanery" id="image_deanery"><img src="images/deanery.jpg" alt="The Deanery" /></a>
    <p class="caption">
       The Deanery
    </p>
</div>

<p>On the south of this stands the Deanery, entered
by three remarkably acute arches of Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>’s
time. Under these the Dean has placed, for the
benefit of the public, some of the Roman tesselated
pavement found in 1880 in Dome Alley. The wayfarer
can also see in the red-brick wing on the east
the handsome Perpendicular window which once stood
at the end of the prior’s hall. The Deanery has been
almost entirely built inside this hall. It may surprise
some to hear that this magnificent building,
dating from 1460, still exists in a perfect state. Of
the rooms constructed in it the largest is the drawing-room,
thirty feet long and fourteen high, with old
mullioned and trefoil-headed windows. The height of
the hall was about forty feet, and the length nearly
seventy. In the bedrooms the carved roof timbers
and corbels, with heads cut on them, are in wonderful
preservation. The wing of red brick, of which
I have spoken, was built for Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s accommodation;
and in his time the Deanery staircase seems to
have been constructed, where there was formerly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
courtyard in the house. The prior’s hall could be
easily restored, and if the work were effected in the
time of the present dean, it would form a suitable
memorial of the taste and learning of that eminent
antiquary.</p>

<p>Evelyn records an edifying conversation which took
place in this house when he was here shortly after the
death of Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> James was then here:&mdash;</p>

<p>“His Majesty was talking with the bishop concerning
miracles and the Saludadors in Spain, who
would creep into heated ovens without hurt. His
Majesty said he doubted about miracles. The bishop
added a miracle wrought in Winchester to his certain
knowledge&mdash;a poor miserably sick and decrepit child
(long kept unbaptized) recovered immediately after
baptism&mdash;as also the salutary effect of King Charles’
blood in healing one that was blind. They then
spoke of second sight. The King spoke of relics
which had effected cures, especially a piece of our
Saviour’s Cross, which had healed a gentleman’s
rotten nose by only touching. The bishop blessed
the King for insisting on having the negroes in the
plantations christened.”</p>

<p>The Deanery faces the Close, which formerly had
the pleasant name of “Mirabel,” and we crossed it to
the Pilgrims’ Hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ornaments.</div>

<p>The northern part of this building is now the
dean’s stable&mdash;the form of it can therefore be well
seen. The commencement of the massive beams
supporting the roof is visible in the lower part of the
stable, while in the loft the arches themselves remain
adorned with heads. These carvings are much
injured by time&mdash;one of the faces seems to represent
a nun or priest, and another with a curly beard, perhaps
a king. This woodwork dates from 1280, and
we hope its fine effect was appreciated by the
travellers who occupied and had fires lit in it. The
other half of the building is in the adjoining house
(Canon Durst’s) where the beams are still visible, but
without carving. The latter residence was built by
Warden Nicholas about two hundred years ago, and
has over the staircase some fine festoons of large
flowers in stucco.</p>

<p>Crossing over to the western side of the precincts
we find <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 10 to be an old thirteenth-century building,
said to have been part of the convent refectory.<a name="Anchor_92" id="Anchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">[92]</a>
Beneath it there is still a kitchen, a grand hall with
three round pillars and a groined roof. The massive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
oak dresser-board remains resting on two carved stone
supports. Though worked almost into holes, its
hardness has preserved it to be a curious relic. When
Richard Cœur de Lion returned from his foreign
imprisonment, the grand coronation dinner was here
prepared for him.<a name="Anchor_93" id="Anchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">[93]</a></p>

<p>“There must have been then great commotion
in this hall, and considerable execution,” said Mr.
Hertford, “if the culinary work in those days
approached that of the ‘kokery’ in the days of
Richard <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, with all its ornamental devices.”</p>

<p>“Let us dream on,” I replied; “but good authorities
consider that this ground-floor was only made a
kitchen in the seventeenth century; and that these
buildings of the monastery did not form part of the
Refectory, though close to its site.”</p>

<p>By the kindness of Miss Heberden we were allowed
to inspect this interesting house, and having viewed
the kitchen, ascended by a fine old oak staircase to a
spacious room, now used as a bedroom, lined with
that small square panelling which dates from the
seventeenth century. Here are long, low, many-mullioned
windows, with stained glass, representing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
arms of Fox, Wykeham, and others. Over the
mantel-piece is an elaborate piece of oak carving.
In the south gable end there is a beautiful rose
window, traces of a larger one, and of the original
entrance&mdash;the present door being in an old window.
On the east are Early English windows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dome Alley.</div>

<p>Close to this house there is a road running westward.
This is Dome Alley. On either side of it
stand red brick houses, some two hundred years old,
half concealed in luxuriant ivy. We observed grapes
and other ornamental designs on the leaden pipes;
on the right hand side the “Rose and Crown,” and
on the left the “Cross Keys.” It appears that emblematic
ornaments representing the Church and
King went alternately along the fronts of the
houses.</p>

<p>“I suppose the ‘Rose and Crown’ represented the
English monarchy?” said Miss Hertford.</p>

<p>“The rose,” I replied, “was an ancient emblem of
England; some have supposed the name Albion
came not from the chalk cliffs, but from the white
rose which flowers freely over the country.”</p>

<p>Adjoining the Close gateway we observed a large
building with gables of “timber-crossed antiquity,”
and found that beneath them was an apartment
where the bishop’s “Cheyney” Court was held.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Here are a curious old beam in the ceiling, and the
royal arms, which were over the judge. This was
the Court for the Soke, the prison of which we had
already seen. Old men remember the last case tried
here&mdash;a corn dispute from West Meon. The judge
sat on the side near the porter’s lodge. The overhanging
gables may be earlier than Elizabeth; the rooms
beneath them have been used for Cathedral purposes.</p>

<p>From this point we made a little excursion, passing
under Kingsgate, with its chapel and ancient doors,
into Kingsgate Street to look at the red-brick gables
of Mr. Toye’s house&mdash;dating from about 1600. About
seven years ago some excavations were made through
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Swithun’s Street, the Kingsgate, and Kingsgate
Street, which brought to light the stratum of a road
at a depth of five feet. This must have belonged to
some epoch of considerable civilization, perhaps even
to that of Alfred and the saint who gave the name.
The floor of the porter’s lodge at the Close Gate is
three steps below the present surface.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monks’ Fare.</div>

<p>Hence we retraced our steps through the precincts;
and here, as we stand on the ground for centuries
trodden by religious men whose “good deeds have
been interred with their bones,” let me call attention
to the little that remains concerning them, if it be
merely their domestic arrangements. Dean Kitchin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
has with great perseverance and success deciphered
a roll of regulations for the monastery in the fourteenth
century, which had been rendered indistinct by
the thumbing of many monks, and by a libation of
their beer. Here we find directions as to dietary.
The prior was to provide beer, bread, salt, wine,
butter, and cheese. Nearly every day there was to
be a large maynard of cheese (32 lbs.), and the
anniversary of the deposition of the body of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Swithun was to be honoured with an additional
cheese, so that the monks of Hyde as well of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Swithun might celebrate the day; and on the Translation
of the saint’s body sufficient cheese was to
be provided for those monks and other religious and
lay people. The cheese was to be really good, if not
it was to be returned. Psalm singing was regarded as
thirsty work. The precentor and his men were to have
a puncard (cask) of ale every Saturday, and another
to cheer them whenever they sang the melancholy
“Placebo,” or funeral service. They were to have a
pitcher of wine as well as a puncard of good ale
whenever they did the great O. At first we might
suppose that this was synonymous with “doing the
heavy,” but the dean tells us that, on the contrary, it
generally meant doing nothing at all. But here it
signified singing before the great festivals certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
short prayers, beginning with “O,” the first of which
was “O Sapientia.” On the Deposition of the body
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Æthelwold, the keeper of the refectory was to
carry round at dinner time the “Cup of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Æthelwold,”
first to the brethren in the refectory, then into
the infirmary to the sick, and then to the table of
the bled (a considerable number), and finally to the
prior and such honoured guests as were with him.
It is said that they were all to kiss the goblet; but
we should have thought that the old conventuals
would scarcely have expressed such sentiments as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line-1">“Drink to me only with thine eyes,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">And I will pledge with mine,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Or leave a kiss within the cup,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">And I’ll not ask for wine.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Moreover a pitcher of wine was to accompany the
cup which apparently was exhausted before the end
of the ceremony. The refectorarius was to have a
second pitcher for himself, and we might suppose he
wrote this order, for he spells the word in a very
hickupy manner, “pichicherum.”</p>

<p>Wykeham found the monastery in a disorderly
state. Some of the monks were guilty of grave
irregularities. He gave them strict statutes. Wearing
ornaments was forbidden, and also hunting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hunting!” exclaimed Mr. Hertford. “How I
should like to have seen them flying along in their
gowns. Think of the jumps!”</p>

<p>“Wykeham did not like the sight,” I replied; “it
was, I suppose, not an uncommon one, for we find in
Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>’s reign complaints that the dogs of the
Abbot of Hyde and Abbess of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s were committing
depredations in the King’s forests.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Swithun’s Tomb.</div>

<p>Hence we made for the north side of the Cathedral,
where we passed through the iron gate to walk on the
grass. Close to the Cathedral on the north-west near
a water drain, I observed that the ground had been
recently moved, and the sod was broken, revealing a
piece of wall. This was, in fact, the site where <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Swithun had by his own desire been humbly buried,
“so that the sun might not shine upon him.” Since the
translation of his body the earth here had not been
moved until two years ago, when in digging, several
coffins of chalk and stone were found with bones,
and also the mysterious ring already mentioned.</p>

<p>Proceeding towards the east we noticed the doorway
into the north transept by which the pilgrims
entered to have their squint through the grille gate.
Beyond the north transept another cut in the grass
showed a wall of great solidity&mdash;probably part of the
foundations of the “New Minster,” whose monks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
moved to Hyde. This wall, lately discovered, was
traced northwards to a point where a stone has been
placed in the grass, and two other stones show the
building was square. The old Saxon church might
have been here&mdash;some fragments stood above ground
in the beginning of the last century.</p>

<p>We here saw close to us a pointed arch standing
alone. It formerly led to some of the prior’s premises.
To the north of it I saw a line of small,
dilapidated houses, bearing the pretentious name of
“Paternoster Row,” which, I fear, does not always
awaken religious feelings in the hearts of authors.
Some of these dwellings were very old, and boasted
a little external ornamentation. In the doorway of
one of them sat an aged woman sunning herself.
Her features were finely chiselled, and she had a
profusion of white glossy hair. She must have been
handsome when young, and was still</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>I asked her if she could tell us the age of her
house.</p>

<p>“No, I cannot, sir,” she replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span> “but it must be
very old from the way it is built. There are five
doors to this room. Pray walk in.”</p>

<p>We complied, and found a very neat little apartment
with tables covered with ornaments, and a brave
show of glass. There was a beam across the ceiling,
which I could touch with my hand.</p>

<p>“You can see at the back how old the houses are.
Some of the cottages in the corner have lately been
taken down,” she added.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bourne.</div>

<p>We passed with her out of the back door, and saw
some very dilapidated tiled gables. What surprised
me most was to find that a clear stream of water,
about a yard wide, flowed under these houses. This,
then, was the “fishful” rivulet of Æthelwold, the
Lourtebourne, which he brought from Headbourne
Worthy (by a lower channel, I think, than that by the
Nuns’ Walk), to cleanse and refresh the monastery.<a name="Anchor_94" id="Anchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94.">[94]</a>
It was covered here with tombstones. I crossed by
one, taken of course from the neighbouring graveyard,
which commemorated some of the Henley family
who lived in the seventeenth century. Stones of this
kind, as well as monoliths, are utilized here, for stone
is scarce about Winchester. The flight of stairs up
to Morestead Church, which stands above the road
two or three miles from this is formed of tombstones.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>
<p>“I hope that they have been steps to heaven in
every sense,” said Mr. Hertford.</p>

<p>We left the little dwelling very favourably impressed
with the old lady, and were surprised and
sorry when we heard that she was obliged to be in
receipt of parish relief.<a name="Anchor_95" id="Anchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95.">[95]</a></p>

<p>Passing by Bishop Morley’s almshouses for matrons
we regained the High Street, and we now proposed
to make a circuit to look at the streets on the other
side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decay.</div>

<p>Winchester declined greatly in Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>’s
time, and Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> removed the royal residence to
London, and although at Wykeham’s solicitation
Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> made it one of the chief wool marts
in England, he added another disappointment when
he removed the “staple” to Calais. From a dismal
complaint presented to Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> by the inhabitants,
it would appear that the greater part of the town was
then almost a heap of ruins. It states that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>

parish churches and 997 houses were void, and
within eighty years Jewry Street had fallen from
eighty houses to two, Fleshmonger Street from 140
to two, Colebroke Street from 160 to sixteen, Calpe
Street from 100 to six, Gold Street (Southgate
Street) from 140 to eight, Gar Street from 100 to
none. In its palmy days, soon after the Conquest,
the city extended to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cross, Wyke, Worthy, and
Magdalen Hill, and in Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>’s reign the population
was about 20,000, but so greatly did it
decrease that all the progress of this century has
only just brought it back to that number. It is
said that there were once 173 churches and chapels
here, probably an over-statement.</p>

<p>In Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>’s time there were 44, among them
All Saints in Vineis,<a name="Anchor_96" id="Anchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96.">[96]</a> <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas extra Pisces,

Now there are eight; Bishop Fox disestablished
many because there were no funds to sustain the

<p>Proceeding up the High Street, we crossed into <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Peter’s Street by “God Begot” House. This was a
fashionable quarter in the Stuart days. The Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Hotel stands on a site where was a nunnery twenty
years since. We come to the office of the Probate
Court, a new looking building, which has old walls.
At the south side of it we see a leaden pipe with E.G.
1684, on it&mdash;supposed to stand for Eleanor Gwynne.
An old staircase remains at the top of this house.
The original building was much larger, the centre
has been taken down, but the other wing remains.
We may gain some idea of how handsome it once
was by looking at the next ivy-mantled mansion&mdash;a
structure of about the same date, with a fine staircase.</p>

<p>We now come to the Roman Catholic Chapel, and
examine the arched entrance&mdash;the only relic remaining
of Magdalen Hospital, founded 1174. In the
porch I called attention to the “Druidical” stone.</p>

<p>“But some say that the monoliths in this Itchen
valley have more connection with drifts than with
Druids,” observed Mr. Hertford.</p>

<p>“Yes, and take away the poor things’ character,”
I replied. “Why should we try to dive into the mud
and gravel that lie beneath our fancies?”</p>

<p>Close by, standing back in a garden, is the “White
House,” which is also of Stuart date, and has a handsome
staircase and panelled room. All these houses
were probably occupied by Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s courtiers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Milner says that the Duchess of Portsmouth had a
house at the south end of this street.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Middle Brooks.</div>

<div class="figcenter gap_above">
    <a name="image_middle" id="image_middle"><img src="images/middle.jpg" alt="Middle Brook" /></a>
    <p class="caption">
       Middle Brook.
    </p>
</div>

<p>From the end of Peter’s Street we turned down
the City Road, and passing by “Upper Brooks,”
where there are more monoliths, soon entered, on the
right hand, Middle Brooks&mdash;so called from the stream
flowing along it, which in the memory of old people
ran down its centre. Here we came to a remarkable
edifice, built of flints, and of a somewhat “gingerbread”
character&mdash;a miniature castle with two towers.
It forms a couple of houses, and the tenant of the nearer
one told us that the building was called the Hermitage.
It is nearly one hundred years old, and formed
out of the materials of Swathling House,<a name="Anchor_97" id="Anchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">[97]</a> which
belonged to Mr. Erle, and stood between Winchester
and Southampton. The front room, which we were
invited to enter, is lined with panelling&mdash;covered
with paint, I regret to say, for it is of walnut wood&mdash;and
in some places adorned with gold and colours.
Round the ceiling there is a “tongue and udder”
moulding, and there is also carving round the door.
The young tenant pointed out to us an old engraving
on canvas, “The Bloody Sentence of Christ,” which,
he said, had been two hundred years in his family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
There was a note beneath it to say it had been taken
from a stone in Vienna.</p>

<p>Proceeding on towards the High Street we came
to a row of houses with overhanging stories and huge
dark beams. It had a central archway and heavy
oaken door, and seems to have originally formed one
large house. Antiquaries owe a great debt of gratitude
to the owner, Mr. Buckingham, for preserving
this relic of the past when pressure was put upon him
to demolish it. There is much “wattle and dab”
work in the walls, and in an upper front room of the
northernmost house there is herringbone work and
a fine chalk mantelpiece with mouldings and entablature.
Chalk becomes hard from exposure, and will
last almost for ever if protected from the weather.
Cut stone can be seen here in the back wall, and also
in a house beyond the yard fence, whence it has been
conjectured that this was a monastery or important
structure&mdash;could it have been connected with the
Franciscan monastery, usually placed in Lower
Brooks? A cannon ball, found two feet below the
floor of one of the back rooms, is in Mr. Buckingham’s
possession. It probably came from the Castle or
Cromwell’s battery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coins.</div>

<p>Before these houses were repaired, two years since,
some of the panelling inside them was beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
carved, and there still remains ornamental tracery on
the outside of some of the windows, but much has
been removed. What was more remarkable was the
discovery of numerous coins about the panelling, as
if some of them had accidently slipped behind it.
Among them were a Roman coin and a Spanish, some
leaden coins and medals, and a token of the Corporation
of Southampton made of brass, with three roses
on the obverse.</p>

<p>On our way back we met an aged man with a light
blue coat and an oblong silver badge, with something
like a shamrock upon it. The wearer of this gay
apparel belonged to “Christ’s Hospital” (1607), near
the Cathedral. The brethren’s house looked as
bright as their coats, with scarlet virginian and blue
clematis.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As the next day was Sunday, which is no day
for excursions, and we had pretty well explored the
principal part of Winchester, my friends now took
their departure. They said that they had enjoyed
their visit. With me the time had passed rapidly.
I tried to make a favourable impression, and am vain
enough to think I succeeded, especially on one
occasion while Mr. Hertford was deeply studying the
guide-book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>On Sunday morning I felt lonely. I sauntered
down the High Street. There were many young
fellows standing about who had evidently come in
from the country. Some looked very gay, wearing
sunflowers in their buttonholes, and talking to their
sweethearts. This sight made me feel still more
forlorn.</p>

<p>I went to the invisible Church&mdash;I mean <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Lawrence’s&mdash;which cannot be seen from the outside.
The sermon pleased me. I remember that the
preacher said: “Some men put on their religion
on Sundays with their best coat, and when the day
is done take off their religion and their coat, and
hang them up until next Sunday.”</p>

<h2>SEVENTH DAY.</h2>

<p class="summary">Southgate Street &mdash; <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cross &mdash; Dr. Lewis &mdash; Regulations &mdash; <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Catherine’s Hill.</p>

<p>This day I proceeded in the direction of the Hospital
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cross, which is one mile from Winchester.
On my way down Southgate Street I passed,
on my right, the profusely decorated and almost
flamboyant modern Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas. It
contains some of the sepulchral slabs of the older
church to that saint, which stood beside the graveyard
on the east side of the road. That building
had some architectural beauties, but had long lapsed
into a state of dilapidation. In Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>’s time
the Sheriff of Southampton was ordered to have an
image of the “Majesty of the Lord” made and
placed beyond the altar in that church.</p>

<p>A few yards beyond this I passed the site of the old
Southgate, and then came to the “Friary”&mdash;the site
upon which the Augustine hermits established themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
in the thirteenth century. This order is best
known to London men, from Austin Friars in the
City.</p>

<p>Next I came to “<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s,” the rectory of the
parish. Just behind it stands the church, but it has
been rebuilt, and presents nothing of interest except a
round thirteenth-century sun-dial not eight inches wide.
In former times a spring rose just above the church,
and in the winter flooded it on its way down. The
rector keeps the doors of the church always open, and,
like many others, has suffered for his good nature.
A short time since the poor-box was broken open
and robbed, and the only melancholy consolation was,
that there was not much in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cross.</div>

<p>A line of bright villas extends here on the right
side, and I soon reached the graveyard of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Faith’s,
another deceased church. Even in the time of Henry
<abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> it was in a weakly state, for we find beech trees
given to prop its foundations. The only relic of it
remaining, is the Norman font and bell, which are
preserved at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cross.</p>

    <p class="caption">
       The Church of Saint Cross from the Water Meadows.
    </p>
</div>

<p>Here I am now at my destination. I pass
through the village of Sparkford,<a name="Anchor_98" id="Anchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">[98]</a> and stand before
the ancient structure founded by Bishop de Blois for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the (much needed) health of his soul and for the
repose of the kings of England. He endowed it from
his private revenues, as well as from gifts of rectories
and from the spoils of Hyde Abbey, which consisted
of 500 pounds weight of silver, 30 marks of gold, and
three crowns of gold, with thorns of gold set with
diamonds. The revenue was originally <abbr title="250 pounds">£250</abbr> a year,
but had risen to <abbr title="300 pounds">£300</abbr> in Wykeham’s time.</p>

<p>The management of the hospital was originally
delegated to the brethren of the Hospital of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John
of Jerusalem, saving to the Bishop of Winchester
canonical jurisdiction, but Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> gave the
administration entirely into the hands of the bishops.</p>

<p>On the tower over the archway are four heads&mdash;those
of Henry <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>, “time-honoured” Lancaster,
Beaufort, and Catherine Swinford. Catherine here
finds herself in good company. She was, as most
know, a pretty governess, whom John of Gaunt’s wife
had the temerity to engage, with the result that
her husband had several natural children, among
them Cardinal Beaufort. Over these heads are three
canopied niches for statues&mdash;the idea being evidently
taken from those on the tower of the College. In
the centre was the Virgin, and by her side the
Cardinal; but we observe that though he is on his
knees he is too grand to take off his hat to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
When the figure of the Virgin fell, some years since,
it was not replaced.</p>

<p>How well I remember the day when I first stood
before this gateway as a tired wayfarer, and demanded
the pilgrim’s right. I was promptly provided
with half a pint of fair small beer and half a slice of
bread. I observed that the drinking-horn was set in
silver, and, in answer to a question, was informed&mdash;</p>

<p>“Two of the cups have been set in silver to commemorate
the fact that the Prince of Wales and
Crown Prince of Germany drank out of them. The
other cups are not set; we keep these for the upper
classes.”</p>

<p>I had not then heard of the fate of the “Hampshire
Grenadier,” and much cheered by the refreshment and
the fragrance of royalty, marched into the courtyard,
and admired the long row of chimneys&mdash;twenty feet
high&mdash;made thus when they first succeeded holes in
the roof. I wished I could see the thatch that the
chapel had for two hundred years. Seeing an old
gownsman standing about I accosted him, and asked
if he would be so good as to show me over the hospital.</p>

<p>“Hospital!” he replied, sharply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> “There ain’t no
hospital here. That’s where everybody makes a mistake.
When any of the brethren are ill we have to
send to Winchester for a doctor.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="image_beaufort" id="image_beaufort"><img src="images/beaufort.jpg" alt="Beaufort Tower, Saint Cross" /></a>

</div>

<p>“Well&mdash;the institution” I substituted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>He seemed satisfied with the correction. I found
that there were several persons waiting to be conducted,
and that our guide was a “character.” He
was deaf, his speech was indistinct from the loss of
teeth, and he in every respect came up to the requisite
qualification of being decayed.</p>

<p>The original foundation was for the board and
lodging of thirteen men, poor and infirm, and for
receiving daily at dinner a hundred men<a name="Anchor_99" id="Anchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">[99]</a>&mdash;the most
indigent that could be found&mdash;who were to be allowed
to carry away the remains of their food and beer.</p>

<p>“Walk this way,” said our guide, hobbling on in
front of us. “Oh! I won’t go too fast for you.”</p>

<p>He led us into the church, where we gazed up at
rows of Norman zig-zag until we felt quite giddy.
Some think the painting here a little overdone, but it
gives some idea of how the severity of the Norman
style was softened by colours. A few traces of the old
designs are still visible in some places on the walls,
and in À Becket’s Chapel there are remains of a series
depicting the scenes in his life. There is also a large
fresco, even more faded, representing the Descent
from the Cross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“We have heard,” said an inquiring lady, who
seemed to take a great interest in everything, “that
there is a beautiful triple arch here. Can we see it?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, you cannot,” replied our scrupulous
guide; “but you will be able to do so when we come
to it. This is Major Lowth’s seat,” he added, pointing
to one comfortably cushioned.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” inquired the lady. “Where do you
say he sits?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere, ma’am. He does not sit anywhere now.
He is gone to heaven, ma’am&mdash;at least, I hope so.
He was one of the trustees.”</p>

<p>We found the triple arch outside at the back of
the church. It was very pretty&mdash;one arch bisecting
another.</p>

<p>The fourteenth-century stained glass in the windows
particularly attracted my attention. In one, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Swithun appears in a purple robe; in another, De
Blois figures in red and green. In the South Chapel
there is some wood carving of the Italian school, and
very fine; and some other that is certainly of the
British school, and not admirable&mdash;names cut on
the desks, one of which dated 1575, shows that chanting
and mischievous habits survived the Reformation.</p>

<p>Our attention was also drawn to the stone with the
half-obliterated “<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">Have Mynde</span>” on it, and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
window whence the sick witnessed the elevation of
the Host.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Handsome Donation.</div>

<p>We observed on some of the tiles on the floor
of the church the enigmatical letters, “Z. O.” On
inquiry, we found this apparently cabalistic sign,
was in memory of the munificence of an anonymous
benefactor, who thus signed his letters. About
twenty-five years ago a gentleman came to visit the
hospital, and seeing some men at work in the church,
observed to them that it was a most interesting
building.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied one of them; “but it is sadly
out of repair.”</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards a letter arrived from the Isle
of Wight, telling the Master to go to a certain bank
in Winchester, and he would receive <abbr title="500 pounds">£500</abbr> from Z. O.
And soon <abbr title="250 pounds">£250</abbr> came in the same way. Many were
the surmises as to who was the mysterious donor;
some thought from certain indications that he was
one of the royal family.</p>

<p>“We want a few more of that sort,” observed our
guide, significantly.</p>

<p>The church, which is partly paved with fifteenth-century
tiles, contains many sepulchral memorials.
There is a fine brass to the left of the altar to Campeden,
one of the masters and a friend of Wykeham’s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
The tomb of Petrus de Sancta Maria, who died in
1295, was opened some time since, and the features
were found perfect; but as has happened in other
cases, crumbled into dust in sight of those present.
Wood says there was an old cross here, dated 1450,
to John Newles, “<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">squyer and servant more than xxx
yere unto Harry Beauford, bishop and cardinal, whose
soulys God convey to his Mother dere unto the bliss
of Heaven</span>.”</p>

<p>In front of the altar there is a large slab to William
Lewis. He was elected from Hart Hall at Oxford
to the Society of Oriel, in 1608, and made provost by
the favour of Welshmen. There are conflicting statements
about his character. Cromwell’s party say that
his amours were so extraordinary that he was obliged
to fly from the country to escape the officers of
justice; but the Royalists maintain that he was an
excellent man, learned in theology, who went abroad
to serve the King. Anthony Wood, in his “<cite class="plain" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fasti
Oxonienses</cite>,” says that “he was made a <abbr title="Doctor of Divinity">D.D.</abbr>
by command of the King.” He went as Buckingham’s
chaplain&mdash;with a sinecure office, I should think&mdash;to
the siege of Rochelle, of which he wrote an
account. He was Master of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cross; but on the
defeat of Charles was succeeded by Lisle the regicide,
who sat in the Long Parliament for Winchester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Lisle’s widow was beheaded in the Market Place in
Winchester, for harbouring fugitives from Sedgemoor.<a name="Anchor_100" id="Anchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">[100]</a>
After his promotion to the Upper House, another
regicide, Cooke, became Master, and after his execution,
Lewis returned and ended his life here in peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hall of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cross.</div>

<p>Our guide now directed us to the hall&mdash;built in 1440&mdash;and
here called attention to the Minstrels’ Gallery,
the fine original roof, the mysterious triptych painting,
and the central hearth whence in olden times
the smoke ascended through a hole in the roof. This
aperture was long preserved, and on “gaudy days”&mdash;of
which there are five in the year&mdash;a charcoal fire is
still lit there for “Auld Lang Syne.” On those days
there is a grand roast of half an ox, minus the leg,
and each man has five pounds of meat, a mince-pie,
and plum pudding.</p>

<p>“And who sits in that chair?” asked the inquiring
lady, indicating the principal one at the table.</p>

<p>“Nobody, ma’am,” he replied, “at present. But on
gaudy days the Master sits in it.”</p>

<p>“Is he one of the brethren?”</p>

<p>“God bless your soul, no, ma’am,” he returned;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
“he’s a minister of the gospel.”</p>

<p>We were shown Cardinal Beaufort’s rude wooden
salt-cellars and candlesticks, and in the kitchen his
battered round pewter dish, which gave us no great
idea of his splendour; but probably he was doing the
humble when he stayed here.</p>

<p>Thence we went over to the eastern side of the
quadrangle, where there is a cloister supporting some
decayed apartments&mdash;perhaps erected by De Blois.
Here is a table of Purbeck marble, said to have been
used in the Castle, and which as it is not round
enough for King Arthur, is usually attributed to
King Stephen.</p>

<p>“Would you like to see the nunnery?” inquired
our guide.</p>

<p>We were not aware that there was one, but found
that it consisted of some upper rooms for three nurses.
On asking what there was to see in it, and being told,
“Well! there is a floor,” none of us felt very enthusiastic
about it. And so I left this interesting spot&mdash;not
to return for fifteen years. Farewell, most conscientious
of guides! I am afraid, alas! that thou art
“not sitting anywhere now.” I hope thou too art in
heaven.</p>

<p>On this, my next visit, our conductor was a man
of the modern school, intelligent and energetic, but
not so humorous. I went the same round, and heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
little more&mdash;except that an American gentleman, who
had been two months in England studying stained
glass, had heard of the ancient windows here just
as he was going on board the steamer to return, had
retraced his steps, and said when he saw them that
he was well repaid for his journey. Our guide also
spoke of the silver cross the brethren wear. It seems
when any one of them dies it is put on a red velvet
cushion, which is laid on his breast in the coffin,
and then before burial it is taken off and the Master
fastens it to the gown of the next brother. Instances
have been known where, by mistake, the cross has
been left on the corpse, and there was a brother who
was now wearing one which had been exhumed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Brew.</div>

<p>Only when we came to look at the black jacks and
talk of the beer was our informant slightly at fault.
The founder, thinking that his bedesmen would be
thirsty souls, ordered each to have daily with his meat
and salad mortrell (bread and milk) a gallon and a
half of good small beer. Considering this and the
free drinks given at the lodge&mdash;now reduced to two
gallons a day&mdash;we may suppose that brewing was a
principal industry in the hospital. No beer is now
made here or supplied to the men. Our guide told
us that about seven years ago the brethren’s wives
lived in the village, and that a question was asked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
which they preferred&mdash;their beer or their wives. To
some this might have been puzzling; but the gallant
Knights of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cross answered without hesitation
in favour of their better halves. This raised them
greatly in my estimation; but it appears that, in
truth, their wives, or in default of them, housekeepers,
have been allowed to live here as far back as most
people can remember, and the allowance of beer
was stopped, because some of the men took too
much of it, and others preferred stronger stuff, being
of the monkish opinion that&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">and exchanged it in the village. So they were glad
to take money instead.</p>

<p>The greater part of the building here is due to
Cardinal Beaufort&mdash;the gateway, hall, master’s house,
and all the lodgings on the west side. He called the
hospital the “Almshouse of Noble Poverty,” and
provided an endowment by which some brethren who
had “seen better days” should be added to the
thirteen of the De Blois foundation. A distinction
between the two classes is kept up, the Beaufort
men wearing red gowns, but there are very few of
them. I heard that a clergyman was here a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
years since, but resigned his place. Provision was
made for the maintenance of eleven servants and
fourteen horses. The present revenue is about <abbr title="6000 pounds">£6,000</abbr>
a year.<a name="Anchor_101" id="Anchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 101.">[101]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catherine’s Hill.</div>

<p>On leaving the hospital, instead of returning as I
came, I went to the right through a gate and over a
stream; and, following a northerly path across the
fields by the engine house, crossed the Itchen to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Catherine’s Hill, which I saw rising close to me.
There was formerly a chapel on it, the tower of which
was blown down in 1268, but the building was there
in Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>’s time.</p>

       <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catharine’s Hill from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cross.
    </p>
</div>

<p>A splendid view opened as I climbed the height.
On the summit I inspected the mismaze. It is
fancifully said to have been cut by the boy who
wrote “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dulce Domum</span>.” But when we consider the
Cerne Giant and the White Horse we shall consider
it due to the vicinity of the monastery, and made
by the monks for amusement or penance. It is not a
labyrinth properly so-called, because if you enter at
one end you cannot fail to reach the other. I saw
some children, who had been playing “touch wood”
in the neighbouring clump of pines, walking through
it, and they said it could be done in four minutes.</p>

<p>Here I stand within a magic circle&mdash;a line of circumvallation
which transports me to a past when
there was a wild population here that threw up
intrenchments to protect themselves and their cattle
from attack. The large circuit of this embankment
shows that the habitations around the neighbourhood
were not sparse; for we may be sure that when they
had to throw up the earth with their hands, they
would not make it larger than necessary, and when
they lived much on game they did not require great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
space for cattle. These remains are especially interesting
in connection with the many “Druidical”
monoliths found about this part of the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of Winchester.</div>

<p>We may say that this was the original site of
Winchester. When the people became powerful and
more constantly centralized, they settled on the lower
ground, as at Bristol and Salisbury. Some twenty
miles to the south-east there is a fortified height
known as “Old Winchester hill,” and so-called from a
tradition that the town at first stood upon its summit.</p>

<p>While descending on the turf among the harebells
(hairbells?) I found a specimen of the blue gentian.
What a study is every flower&mdash;how beautifully is it
finished inside and outside! I thought of the “lilies
of the field.” Solomon and his array! How would
he have looked with his robes reversed?</p>

<p>I made my way to the river, and walked along it
in a path fringed with golden ragwort, then passed
through the millyard, crossed the river, and continued
along its margin till I reached the cottage gardens,
and emerged close to the bridge at the end of High
Street.</p>

<p class="summary">Ancient Britons &mdash; <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s Church &mdash; Magdalen

<p>Chilcombe!&mdash;in the <cite class="plain">Domesday Book</cite> Ciltecumbe&mdash;what
a deliciously Celtic name! It reminds us of
the time when “Gwent” also was only a group of
beehive huts. We can see such in Cornwall at the
present day.</p>

<p>“Gwent” (whence <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Venta Belgarum</span><a name="Anchor_102" id="Anchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102.">[102]</a> and Winchester)
signified an opening. A river beneath a
grassy hill was a cheering sight to the early inhabitant
of Britain. The chalk downs here afforded a clear
expanse by which he could reach the interior of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
country without any fear of losing his way among
trees or being attacked by wild beasts. The forests
then abounded with large stags, wolves, bears, and
wild oxen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Itchen.</div>

<p>No doubt the choice of the site was partly determined
by the convenience of the Itchen. On its
breast we see successively the canoes and coracles of
the Britons, the galleys of the Romans, and the royal
ships of the Saxons and Danes, with their many
oars, pictured sails, and formidable figure-heads.
In the time of the Normans it became more crowded,
and without it the Cathedral could not have been
built, as the stone came from quarries in the Isle
of Wight. Even Wykeham obtained materials from
this source, and the river must have presented a busy
scene in the palmy days of the fair, when merchandise
was arriving from distant shores. The river was
afterwards disused, obstructed apparently by the
construction of mills, for when the city was in a
dilapidated condition in Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>’s time, the
Mayor and Corporation suggested that the mills
should be “pulled up, so that barges might come
to the city as formerly.” In recent times a canal
has been made, called “the navigable Itchen,” a name
which, as we look at its silent and deserted course,
seems to have a sound of mockery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Chilcombe is a large parish, and reaches nearly
into Winchester. Cynegils in the seventh century
gave it to the monastery. But on the high ground
above Chilcombe Lodge, the present parsonage, was
lately found a curiosity which carries back our retrospect
far beyond all such modern history. In sinking
a well an aërolite was discovered imbedded forty feet
in the chalk! Can we imagine the time when this
bolt fell hissing into the sea, and lodged upon some
of the shellfish, whose remains formed these white
rocks? The “everlasting” hills did not then exist,
and the most important inhabitants of the earth were
huge and hideous lizards. Does the thought occur
to us that in the cycles of ages the time may return</p>

<p class="noindent">if it does let us banish it.</p>

<p>Crossing Soke Bridge and passing Water Lane I
came, on the same side, to St. John’s Street. Close
to this, on the slope of St. Giles’ hill was the
original school where Alfred was instructed. We
find, in the <cite class="plain">Close Rolls</cite>, King John ordered William
of Cornhill, to make one “Jeffery” attend school
at Winchester, and provide him with necessaries for
the purpose.</p>

    <p class="caption">
       St John’s from a Cottage Garden
    </p>
</div>

<p>Proceeding along the street I came to the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
of St. John. It has no chancel, and is nearly square&mdash;would
have been perfectly so, only for the road
which passes it. This was the old Roman road from
Canterbury, and this was the first church pilgrims
came to in the suburbs of Winchester, hence we find
a Decorated niche outside the east wall in which stood
a figure of the Virgin for their benefit. Inside the
church are many little niches, a very pretty triple one
has just been discovered near the altar. There are
also two “squints.” The tower, which may be partly
Saxon, is a mass of chalk six feet thick. There were
at one time some frescoes on the north wall, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the devil was a principal character, but for more than
twenty years they have been decently plastered up,
and there is nothing now to offend the eyes of the
worshipper unless it be the large crucifix over the
rood screen. A new stained east window has lately
been inserted in memory of a curate who died here
at the early age of twenty-five. He took great
interest in the church, and bravely continued his
work until within four months of his death. The
centre of the window contains what I was told was a
good likeness of him.<a name="Anchor_103" id="Anchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103.">[103]</a></p>

<p>Near the end of the street I came to an ancient
wooden cottage with heavy beams, which had
formerly been the “Blue Ball.” Opposite stands
“St. John’s Croft,” a large red-brick edifice, adorned
with wood-carving on its porch, and with some cut
stone bosses from Magdalen Hospital. A few yards
behind this there is a row of four brick-and-tile cottages&mdash;the
last remains of that celebrated foundation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Morn Hill.</div>

<p>Passing in front of St. John’s Croft I came to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
pathway on a bank beside the high road, and soon, as I
proceeded up the hill, a fine view opened on the left
over the valley and the rich fields through which
the Itchen meanders&mdash;and then the country on the
right became visible, and I reached a breezy down
spangled with harebells and eyebright. Here I
came to Victoria Hospital; and on the right hand,
about a hundred yards this side of the farmhouse
beyond it, stood the Magdalen (“Morn”) Leper Hospital.
I am able to speak with certainty, for a lady
told me that an old gentleman, who died twenty
years ago, pointed out the spot to her and showed
her some tiles that had fallen from the roof. A well
was lately found in the field opposite. I am sorry to
say that this establishment was badly treated in 1643
by the Royalist soldiers, who burned the gates and
consumed the provisions.</p>

<p>A picture of the four pointed arches and lofty
windows which stood here at the end of the last
century can be seen in the Winchester Museum. It
is interesting now that every vestige of this hospital
has disappeared&mdash;except the archway in the Roman
Catholic Chapel in St. Peter’s Street&mdash;to read in the
<cite class="plain">Harleian Manuscripts</cite> (328) of the ornaments it once
possessed&mdash;the silver pix and cups, the vestments and
books, the green carpet powdered with birds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
roses, the Spanish cloth, given by William of Basing,
and the standards to be carried on Rogation days.
This hospital was founded in 1174 by Bishop Toclyve,
whose signature to a document is a great curiosity in
the British Museum. The ruins were removed at the
beginning of this century, as they had become an
harbour for mendicants not belonging to religious
orders.</p>

<p>The distance is about a mile and a half from the
Butter Cross, and this seems to have been thought
anciently, as it is now, a safe position for the location
of infectious and contagious diseases.</p>

<p>Returning, and passing the Victoria Hospital a few
hundred yards, I struck right across the downs and
saw on my left five mounds, which brought other sad
memories of disease, for here the bodies of those who
died of the plague were thrown into pits. It was on
these downs that King John hypocritically fell down
on his knees before the Pope’s prelates. Here they,
weeping, raised him up, and all proceeded to the
Cathedral singing the Fiftieth Psalm.<a name="Anchor_104" id="Anchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104.">[104]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Longwood.</div>

<p>Looking southwards I saw under me the Petersfield
road, to which I descended, and walked on it right
away for more than a mile to visit the Punchbowl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
a circular hollow in the downs, almost capacious
enough for that thirsty Dutchman who drank the
Zuyder Zee. From thence, if I had desired, I might
have marched on for three or four miles to the beautiful
woods of Longwood. I well remember having
once walked through them on a summer evening,
when the sunshine was casting a chequered glow
through the oaks and beeches&mdash;such scenes are not
easily forgotten. Lord Northesk still retains the old
family mansion, though a handsome new residence
has been built beside it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chilcombe.</div>

<p>On this occasion I was not so enterprising, so
returning nearly to where I took the road, I turned
to the left towards Chilcombe, which I saw lying in
a nook among the hills shaded with large trees.
This hamlet is still nearly as small as it was in the
time of the ancient Britons. After reaching and
passing by the half-dozen cottages which compose it,
the road decreased to a lane, and became steep as I
approached the church. This was truly the “church
in the wilderness.” There was no house near it at
which I could obtain the key, so I had to turn back
to the village. On my way I met some little children
playing, one of whom, a girl of about twelve, regarded
me through her dark eyes with undisguised
curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you tell me who has the key of the church?”
I inquired.</p>

<p>“The clerk has it,” she replied; “but he’s dead.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="image_chilcombe" id="image_chilcombe"><img src="images/chilcombe.jpg" alt="Chilcombe Church" /></a>
    <p class="caption">
       Chilcombe Church.
    </p>
</div>

<p>This answer well-nigh threw me into despair;
but I determined to inquire at some neighbouring
cottages. At one where I applied, the fair occupant
also gave me a vague reply, saying that, “If it’s
anywhere, Mrs. Solomons has it.” I observed that
this little dwelling was in a very decrepit state. The
ceiling, which a tall man might reach, was innocent
of plaster, and made a sad exhibition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span> “ribs
and trucks.”</p>

<p>“This seems to be an old house,” I said.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir, very,” she responded. “It has been
for a long time falling down through the chimney,”
she added, pointing to the wide hearth.</p>

<p>Following her advice, I went to the former parsonage,
close at hand, which I reached under a snow-white
mass of fragrant clematis. There I obtained
what I required and returned to the church.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>This tiny sanctuary has a wooden bellcot for a
tower, and the smallest east window I ever saw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
inserted within the original Norman opening. There
are three Norman arches here, some fifteenth-century
tiles, and an old flat monumental slab, from which all
but a large cross has been worn off by the feet of
generations. And this is all that remains of the nine
churches which once adorned Chilcombe!</p>

<p>The lane leading to the church gradually dwindles
to a footpath and crosses the downs to Morestead&mdash;a
pleasant walk. I met some boys coming
along it, carrying wallets full of nuts, with which the
wayside abounds.</p>

<p>On my return I diverged to the right along a green
bridle path, and thus made a circuit of the hamlet.</p>

<p>Before reaching Winchester (two miles) I passed a
large tree standing up quite dead, a piteous skeleton,
shining and bleaching in the sun. It had been struck
with lightning, I was told. I never before saw such
a sight; but in Australia, where the settlers pay the
natives to ring-bark the trees, you may see forests
of them raising up their bare arms to heaven, as if
appealing against the treatment they had received.</p>

    <p class="caption">

    </p>
</div>

<p>Passing Chilcombe Lodge, with its cypresses, I
came to an old inn called “The Brewers Arms,” and
was told that a hostel formerly called “The Drum”
had stood on this site for four hundred years. Close
to it is the church of St. Peter’s Cheesehill. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
people call it “Chisel”; it is named from gravel
like the Chesil Beach near Weymouth. The church
is square like St. John’s. It contains some handsome
chalk niches, with heads carved under them,
and there is a curious grating high up in the west
wall for those in the adjoining house to hear the
service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Twyford.</div>

<p>A pleasant walk leads from the bridge along the
bank of the river to Twyford&mdash;three miles distant&mdash;but
I started in that direction through Southgate
Street, which is part of the Southampton Road. After
passing St. Cross and proceeding on for about a half-mile,
I came to a bifurcation and a signpost, and took
the lower road to the left, walking by grassy banks
golden with fleabane. I crossed the Itchen, and
soon a branch of that river&mdash;fringed with a line of
wild foliage, purple willow-herb and hemp agrimony.
Then I reached Twyford Lodge, the residence of
Colonel Bates, and farther on took the right-hand
turning to the church. It is modern except the
window, but stands on a ring of prehistoric monoliths,
preserving the old sanctity of the place. The
graveyard is adorned with some magnificent coniferæ,
specimens of the Wellingtonia, deodara, picea
pinsapo, cypress, and cedar; but the pride of the
whole is an immense yew-tree which rises in the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
in ancient majesty. It is of great girth, and withal
as sound as a bell, and it is cut into the form of one&mdash;or,
I might say, of Robinson Crusoe’s umbrella. Go
beneath it and gaze up into its maze of branches&mdash;a
wondrous sight!</p>

<p>On leaving this shrubbery I turned round to the
left, and, had I desired, I could have walked through
“silken grass,” across a couple of fields, to the railway
station, passing by the woods round Shawford Park
(Sir Charles Frederick’s), and over the river, which is
here divided into three parts.<a name="Anchor_105" id="Anchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105.">[105]</a> But I sat down to
rest upon a seat placed by some fairy godmother at
the first bridge, and looked down into the Itchen,
where the long green foliage was waving like the hair
of water nymphs. Does not Tennyson speak of our
life swaying “like those long mosses in the stream”?
I seemed to be looking down into a clear agate and
the liquid murmur was only broken at intervals by
the jumping of a trout.</p>

<p>Before me lay two elephantine blocks of stone,
brought by some of our unknown predecessors. I
amused myself with conjuring up pictures of the past,
and thinking that here&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">and while I fancied I could still hear his low
chanting, my mind wandered off to reflect that this
neighbourhood is sacred to a real modern “druid.”
There was a celebrated school at Twyford and among
its pupils was Pope. His satiric talent brought, as
usual, disgrace, for he was sent away for writing a
squib on the master, who had become a Roman
Catholic.</p>

<p>Returning to the church, I regained the high road,
and immediately on my right saw a large red-brick
house, which had an air of old-fashioned importance.
I was anxious to find Shipley House, where
Franklin, as a guest of Bishop Shipley, wrote his
life. I could find no one to inquire from, but soon
a labouring man came along, and I asked him if this
was Shipley House.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” he replied, “this is Twyford House.
Shipley House is nearly a mile further on.”</p>

<p>I was surprised to hear this.</p>

<p>“Is it an old house?” I said.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir&mdash;it was built in 1860.”</p>

<p>This then was not the object of my search, and I
found that the mansion I was looking at was the old
Shipley House.</p>

       Twyford. Queen of Hampshire Villages.
    </p>
</div>

<p>Passing by a school on the left, and entering the
street of the little town, I saw in the centre of it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
blacksmith’s shop with another megalith in front of
it. Dean Kitchin has given the great stones, with
which this place abounds, their full weight, and
considers that Twyford may be so called from
Tuesco, the deity we commemorate on Tuesday.
Further on I came to a brewery, evidently not for
small beer, for it had a triumphal arch with a profusion
of embellishments which must irritate the
feelings of good teetotalers. There are besides these
new structures some timber-crossed cottages in the
village, with old-fashioned hollyhocks, blue campanulas,
and masses of phlox. Before leaving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
I may observe, that this “Queen of Hampshire
villages” ought to be in high favour with the fair
sex as many of them have become Young by residing
in it.</p>

<p>Proceeding straight on into the country, I came
to the Manor farm with several old arches in front
of it, suggestive of a monastery. A little beyond
this is the lodge of the present Shipley House, with
two tall cypresses (Lawsonianæ) in front of it. Then,
coming to another finger-post, I took the beautiful
road to Brambridge,<a name="Anchor_106" id="Anchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 106.">[106]</a> overhung on both sides with
trees. And now a long wall of gravel and mortar
skirts my right along Brambridge Park.<a name="Anchor_107" id="Anchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 107.">[107]</a> The avenue
here is said to be the finest in Hampshire. It consists
of four rows of lime-trees. The double line on each
side is a study for an artist, the outer branches
drooping down and resting on the ground, while the
inner, being close together, have been drawn up, so
that they rise on either side like the columns of a
cathedral. The house belonged to the Fitzherbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
family, and it is locally supposed that George <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>
was privately married in the old chapel attached to it.</p>

<p>Turning round the park on the right, I again
crossed the river, or rather canal, saw a pretty cascade
caused by the old lock, and soon reached the
little old church of Otterbourne&mdash;forsaken and neglected&mdash;standing
in the midst of a yard full of
mouldering gravestones. Many a large and handsome
monument&mdash;thought much of in its day&mdash;is
here entirely concealed in ivy; as completely obscured
and lost to view as those to whose memory
it was erected. Proceeding to the north, I entered
the village of Otterbourne, with its neat new brick
cottages and large green common. In its centre some
children were playing round a large horse-chestnut
tree, whose leaves had been touched by the rosy
fingers of autumn. At the right-hand corner is an
old house of comfortable dimensions, covered with
a variety of climbing plants. This is the quiet village
home of Miss Yonge, the authoress of the “Heir of
Redclyffe.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compton.</div>

<p>From this point I regained the Southampton Road,
and in about a mile turned up to the left to visit
Compton, which consists of a few picturesque tiled
cottages. The tiny church stood in a bed of
luxuriant grass. The fine old oak porch was taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
down by some Vandals fifty years ago, and the
present unsightly one substituted. Lately some of
the parishioners wanted the rector to have a new
door, a request he happily withstood, saying he was
proud of the existing one, which is of great age and
of massive oak. On the lock can be seen the marks
of the axe with which it was rudely shaped. The
entrance arch is Norman, adorned with half-a-dozen
lines of zigzag carving. There is, as at St. Bartholomew’s,
a kind of reflected arch behind it. This
church is an anomaly, inasmuch as it has no foundation;
it merely stands on the chalk, of which the
dressings of the window are also made. Towards
the altar there is on the wall a fresco representing
a bishop with a crozier standing beside the gable of
a church, perhaps intended for the Cathedral. A
stone coffin, containing the skeleton of a giant
measuring six feet to his shoulders, was found here
in front of the altar.</p>

<p>This church stands only a few hundred yards from
the Southampton Road, by which I returned (2 miles)
to Winchester.</p>

<p>Now for a round of fourteen miles. Passing
through the Westgate, I turned to the left by the
barracks and crossed the railway cutting, proceeding
on the road which leads toward the magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Norman church of Romsey, which is twelve miles
distant. On the left I soon came to the Catholic
Cemetery, with its high wall, built in 1829. It
contains many tombstones whose inscriptions are
worn away by age; one preserved by lying flat
under the turf is to a member of the Tichborne
family, dated 1637. Farther on, upon the right,
behind a beautiful belt of trees and some bright
flowers stands concealed the grim arch of the County
Gaol. Nearly opposite is the Infirmary. Farther
on, I passed a large school and waterworks; these
buildings are handsome, and of red brick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oliver’s Battery.</div>

<p>I continued on up the long ascent known as
“Sleeper’s Hill.” The country people tell you that
here seven men fell asleep in a field when the
Cathedral was commenced, awoke when it was
finished, and, after going to inspect it, came back to
their cold bed and crumbled into dust. In about a
mile I saw a clump of dark fir-trees on the left,
standing on a spot called “Oliver’s Battery.” (Any
one wishing to visit it should take the first turning
to the downs, for you cannot cross the fields farther
on.)</p>

<p>This entrenchment was really constructed by
Hopton, though named after Cromwell. On this
ground, the highest near Winchester, we stand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the centre of a grand panoramic scene. Below lies
the city&mdash;its red houses, green trees, and grey
Cathedral. It looked more formidable when this
camp was made; the castle stood at its head, and
the long wall extended down, crowned at intervals
with round towers. There were no suburbs then, and
it seemed among the surrounding pastures like “a
quaint old mosaic in a ring of emeralds.” After leaving
the “Noll” and rejoining the road, I continued towards
Hursley, and observed on the right a monumental
structure just peeping over the hill. On inquiring I
found that this was not a memorial to a hero, but to
a horse! As I go down hill with fine plantations
skirting the road, I observe that I am in the country
of yew-trees, which here replace the “hedgerow
elms,” generally characteristic of England. Sweet
marjoram and masses of wild foliage rise on either
side, and above it gleam in rich profusion the scarlet
clusters of the “dogwood.” On the left is a hill
prettily dotted with small yews and junipers.</p>

    <p class="caption">

    </p>
</div>

<p>The church of Hursley is large and handsome,
and the graveyard beautifully adorned. Inside, at
the west end, we found a brass, not much larger
than an octavo page, recording the name of John
Wolkland, who was keeper of the neighbouring
Castle of Merdon in the fifteenth century. Close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
it rose a large stone slab, commemorative of many
members of the Cromwell family. Richard Cromwell,
the Protector’s son, married one of the Major
family here, and became possessed of the manor.
At his death the place was purchased from the
daughters by Sir W. Heathcote, who took down
the old mansion, saying, I am told, that “the roof
which harboured a Cromwell was not fit to shelter
an honest man.” These reminiscences of fame and
decay are somewhat melancholy. A brass corresponding
to that of Wolkland has a sweeter sound.
It bears the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Keble.</div>

<p>Passing through the southern door into the graveyard,
we find in the grass two flat stones side by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
side with crosses on them and the name of Keble
with that of his wife. He was vicar of this parish.
Although we see here the cold and polished granite
under which he lies, we feel that there is no man
more truly alive among us. He lives in our hearts
and memories&mdash;on our tables, and in our churches.
A friend of mine&mdash;a clergyman who passed early to
his rest&mdash;was accustomed to play and sing every
night with his family that inspiring hymn, “Sun of
my soul.” This large and handsome church is
Keble’s monument, for it was built out of the proceeds
of “The Christian Year.”</p>

<p>From this I return back a short distance to
“Standon Gate,” where a turnpike stood, to visit
Merdon Castle. I pass up a steep hill between
nut-trees to the keeper’s Swiss châlet. Entering
the enclosure, I find vast grassy mounds standing
about on all sides, covering the ruins of the walls
and towers. In one place over the deep fosse a
huge tower of flint masonry remains, the upper part
of which is concealed in ivy. This castle was built
by De Blois in 1138, and fell to decay in the fourteenth
century. A tragic scene took place on this
spot at an earlier date. At “Meretune” King
Cynewulf was murdered by Cynehard in 784. The
former had deposed the brother of the latter, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
was soon afterwards murdered, and Cynehard determined
to be revenged. He lay in wait for some time
among these woods until his victim should come here
with few attendants to visit his mistress. Then he
surrounded the house and killed him.</p>

<p>After leaving Merdon I took another turning to see
the monument on Farley Mount. It is in the form
of a pyramid, and stands on such a high point of
the downs that Salisbury spire is visible from it in
clear weather. Inside there is a room where wayfarers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
and picnic parties may rest and be thankful.
On the wall we read that the horse of Paulet St. John
leaped into a chalk pit and not only was unhurt, but
won the plate at a race the next year!</p>

<p>Many a good man is overlooked in this world
for want of a “horse.” This animal not only bore
its master nobly during life, but has carried his name
to posterity after death. Thus in Olympic times
did Aura immortalize the Corinthian Phidolas, who
raised a statue in her honour.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking like a ball of fire before I
left this spot, and the shadow of the pyramid was
lengthening into a spire on the smooth down.
Descending, I walked along a wire-netting put up
to circumscribe the “bunnies” who swarm in this
neighbourhood, and then came to Crab Wood.
Thence I reached, by the old Roman highway, Tegg
Down, where the soldiers were practising at targets,
and soon was back on the main road near “Oliver’s
Battery.”</p>

<p>The ancient “Gwent” was surrounded by a sea
of foliage. Only in one direction was there an
opening&mdash;over the chalk downs westward. This
vast forest was part of the great Andreds wood
which clothed the chief part of Kent, Sussex, and
Hampshire. Different districts in it had local names.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Southwards from Winchester it came to be called
Bere Forest, and afterwards Waltham Chase. Roman
roads from “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Venta Belgarum</span>” pierced it in several
directions.</p>

<p>There is a story about part of it connected with the
building of the Cathedral. Bishop Walkelin found
himself in want of timber, and applied to the Conqueror
to let him have as much timber as he could
carry out of Hanepinges Wood in four days and
nights. William at once granted the request. The
astute bishop then collected all the woodmen in the
neighbourhood, and they managed to cut and carry
the whole wood within the appointed time. When
the King returned to Winchester and went into
the district he exclaimed&mdash;“Am I bewitched, or have
I lost my senses? Why I thought I had a most
delightful wood here?”</p>

<p>The cause of the clearance was explained to him,
and he was angry; but Walkelin pacified him by
falling on his knees and offering to resign his
bishopric. “I was too lavish a donor, and thou wast
too grasping a receiver,” he finally replied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hampage Oak.</div>

<p>There is a tradition that one tree was spared in
this general clearance&mdash;an oak under which St.
Augustine had preached. I was anxious to see this
venerable relic, and inquired where Hanepinges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Wood was. No one could give me any information.
At last I came to a man upon whom the light
seemed suddenly to break.</p>

<p>“Hanepinges? It must be ‘Hampage.’ There is
the Hampage oak, to the south-east, near Itchen
Abbas. It is rather more than five miles off.”</p>

<p>Wishing to make a round, I walked again to
King’s Worthy, and, keeping to the right, passed on
my left hand Miss Turner’s handsome new residence;
and, on my right, a fine old house with a kind of
tower, which I heard, to my surprise, had been the
old parsonage. A little further on a larger house
with a long façade is that of King’s Worthy Park.</p>

<p>A road pleasantly fringed with trees leads to the
Itchen Abbas station. By taking the train I might
have saved four miles of my walk.</p>

<p>Near this point, a little to the left, on a hill, a
Roman pavement was discovered some years ago.
It was a fine specimen, adorned with the heads of
Medusa, Venus, Neptune, Mercury, and Mars. A
house was built over it for its protection, but was
not kept in repair, the rain came in, the mice and
the tourists arrived, and when I saw it there was little
left; what there is has now been earthed up. Thus
what had lasted nearly two thousand years was destroyed
shortly after it was found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>From Itchen Abbas station I made my way to the
Plough Inn&mdash;a little distance in front towards Easton&mdash;and
passed over the river fringed with its “long
purples.” Then I entered Avington Park, through a
wood of lofty trees, and obtained, across a sheet of
water, a view of the house.</p>

<p>This mansion stands on the site of one of old
renown, which belonged to the princely Brydges,
Dukes of Chandos; and where the “Merry Monarch,”
when sojourning at Winchester, often came and held
high carnival. It was graced or disgraced by a lady
of note; for the first Brydges, being a man of courage,
married that Countess of Shrewsbury, who, disguised
as a page, held a horse for Buckingham while he
killed her husband in a duel. The last Duke of
Chandos built the present house, and also the brick
church&mdash;to which we soon came&mdash;in memory of his
wife. Their daughter, a descendant of Mary Tudor,
Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>’s sister, became Duchess of Buckingham,
and her son sold this property to Mr. Shelley,
the present owner’s father.</p>

<p>Nearly opposite the church is a handsome sarcophagus
to the late Mr. Shelley. The plantations
around the domain are magnificent, the avenue
being two miles in length. After leaving the church
I came to a baker’s shop, and saw a pretty person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
standing in the doorway with “<i>Goodchild</i>” inscribed
in large letters over her. This seemed promising, so
I asked her if she could tell me where to find St.
Augustine’s Oak.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean the Gospel oak?”<a name="Anchor_109" id="Anchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 109.">[109]</a> she replied.
“You must go through the wicket-gate a few yards
above this, and keep along the line of the fence for
about a mile. None of the children here know it.
I doubt whether any of the villagers do. I am sorry
I cannot accompany you, but I am engaged.”</p>

<p>I thanked her. Old Syrus says that a pleasant
companion is as good as a carriage, but as I had no
such conveyance on this occasion, I trudged on in
solitary silence. Following the instructions given, I
soon came to a line of lime-trees, between which and
the fence I walked for half a mile. I began to fear
that I might miss the tree, and go on for an
indefinite distance. There was no one to inquire of,
and nothing to break the stillness save when a
wood-pigeon was heard cooing, or, startled by my
approach, burst out of a tree with great commotion.
Thus I tramped on, over turf sweet with thyme and
starry with cinquefoil. I felt so lonely that I was
glad to see a squirrel which ran along the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
railing beside me, and would stop now and then as
if looking back to see if I was following. Was it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line-1">“Sent by some spirit to mortals good,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Or the unseen genius of the wood.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I know not, but soon he reached a tree up which he
ran, and lo! behind it stood the Hampage Oak.
It was a mere shell about twelve feet high, and kept
together with an iron hoop, but duly honoured by
having an iron fence round it. Among the green,
luxuriant trees it looked like an emblem of death.
I observed that it stood in the centre where two
green alleys crossed. It may have been in this
state of decay for centuries, for oak is very durable,
and Augustine may actually have preached under
it. I should think, from its standing on the cross
roads, that Saxon “moots,” or meetings, may have
been held here, and the chief man may have taken
up his position under it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tichborne.</div>

<p>Returning to the main road, I proceeded through
the village to Tichborne, about three miles farther
on&mdash;the name has become so celebrated that I could
not omit it.<a name="Anchor_110" id="Anchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 110.">[110]</a> About a mile beyond it lies Cheriton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
where the engagement took place between the Royalists
and Roundheads, which ended in the former being
defeated and pursued all through a dreadful night.</p>

<p>The name of Tichborne is supposed to have sprung
from the soil, or, I should say, from the stream which
winds along the park. The church in the village
is most interesting. It retains high oaken pews,
many of them enriched with carving. One side is
entirely occupied by the Tichborne chapel, in which
generations have been laid to rest, but the earliest
memorial is a brass dated 1569. There is a curious
little old effigy of a baby in a red frock, and a very
handsome monument of marble or alabaster to the
Tichborne and his wife of the time of James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr></p>

<p>There is a piece of ground near the house which,
by the unpleasant name of the “Crawls,” commemorates
a most noble action. The lady of Tichborne in
Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>’s reign was famed for her liberality, and,
when aged and dying, wished to establish a dole of
bread to be given to all comers on every Lady Day.
Her husband, who perhaps misliked such indiscriminate
charity, replied that she should have as
much land for the purpose as she could herself walk
round while a torch was burning. Nothing daunted,
she rose from her bed, commenced her pilgrimage,
and on her hands and knees actually encircled several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
acres before her flame expired. The dole of 1,900
loaves continued to the end of the last century, when
old Sir Roger’s misgivings were justified, and as a
substitute money was given to the parish poor.
There can be no doubt about the substantial character
of the gift, but a few regard the story of the
“Crawls” as somewhat airy, and even connect the
name with our old friends the crows.</p>

<p>A magnificent festival was held here lately
when the present baronet came of age. It lasted
three days, and at night the avenue of enormous
elms and beeches shone with thousands of variegated
lamps. Rich and poor were entertained, and many
old Winchester people said, and deliberately too, that
they did not think there ever was a more splendid
spectacle.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
